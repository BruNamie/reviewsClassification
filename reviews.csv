I installed this app to do my work but it will not let me do my work because it will only let me listen to my reacording😡also lag a lot¨x¨x¨¨¨¨1¨119
Never mind the star, only did it to get your attention. Overall the app is very useful and helpful however, Is there a way that you can lock or set a passcode to a document? If there isn’t, I highly recommended.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨119
Why can’t I use FaceID or a password to secure the app?¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨119
Slim it down!¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨119
The document only shows the lines, no text.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨119
If I want to review your app I will. Don&#39;t ask. I even have this toggled OFF in ios settings -&gt; app store but Google drive persists. I&#39;m paying for cloud storage, not to be constantly pestered for reviews....¨¨¨¨x¨¨1¨119

It’s not intuitive. Not for me. “Help” will say “on the menu, select ‘more’, select delete”. There is no “more” choice under menu. And finding the home/back button is hard. The top 10 usual choices one would want to make and you have to go searching for ho¨¨¨¨x¨¨1¨119

What happened to my Google Drive?! Everything was working smoothly before this update!!! Now, my photos won&#39;t load fast - at all!! NOT with internet access or LTE!!!! And I no longer get a bar at the bottom letting me know how many pictures I&#39;ve up¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨119

I had to tear a whole in space time to send a simple document from my home scanner through my iPhone via Gmail. Back to the land of Windows where they actually seem to care about compatibility and ease of use.¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨119
It is not as integrated to other software or operating systems as Dropbox is though it costs almost the same. as to your photos and videos is notes from your iPad or iPhone forget they exist, you have scarce access to them¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨119

I love the app and where always keep my pictures and documents from school but I recently tried to download a picture and it there’s no option that allows me to do so. My brother has the old version and his has the download option... why was that taken awa¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119

I keep trying to upload my resume to some of the job websites and for some reason I am on able to.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119
I can send between 50 and 100 fotos up to my gdrive and then the app just stalls processing any more. Sometimes it’ll start an upload and then just crash. Really inconsistent performance and just stability.¨x¨x¨¨¨¨2¨119
Having a terrible time making files available offline. For whatever reason, it starts to download then stays at about 10%. Even if left alone overnight it doesn’t get past that. Also files take up space when attempted to be made available offline regardles¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119
Please come back pass code security because is very important for me¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119
Does not work with Procreate App which is a huge reason I need an online shareable drive.¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨119

I cant edit my drives that I made on my computer on the app which is very annoying and makes app useless¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119
Bueno no, buenísimo!!!¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨119
Can’t even sort files by modification or creation time.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119
It would be super great if the thing I specifically marked to be available offline (and downloaded days ago) was actually available offline, so I could use it when I need it.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119
Vry nice¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨119
This app is absolutely inferior to other drive services like Dropbox etc (I use both simultaneously) When trying to open an audio file, pdf, jpg etc it takes at least 10x longer (if it even loads) then the other services making it almost impossible to ref¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨119
I was under the impression that the Drive app was just all the other Google Drive-powered apps rolled into one, but the Drive app is only for viewing, and you have to download the other apps in order to edit. There’s really not much of any point to the Goo¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119
Awesome 😃¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨119
G drive seems to be a mess, especially regarding photos and syncing with your PC. Not happy 😝¨¨¨x¨x¨¨2¨119
Not enjoying it when others have so much trouble opening what I send. Even when I make it shareable, they have to start an account with G drive.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119
This is hard to use. It took me longer than it should to find how to organize it with folders and keeps switching between apps. It can’t tell when I want to open something and when I’m just trying to open the menu to do something with it (the three dots). ¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨119
App isn’t intuitive and user friendly¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨119
There are many features that can be easily implemented into this app, but yet after years, you guys haven&#39;t added the option to browse other files while it is playing/viewing another file (such as videos and music)¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119
It is okay. It’s pretty hard to do on a iPhone so it could be improved. It just is hard to move stuff around.¨¨¨x¨x¨¨2¨119
- It is slow many times, even on good connections. - It crashes when uploading multiple files from the phone - You cannot tell files count from the App!!! - Could have a better and more user friendly interface - Could be better overall - especially it ¨¨x¨¨x¨¨2¨119

I am not receiving shared docs from people.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119

Thanks for the drive. However, It should be able to upload when I click out of the app, instead it hangs and fails...¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119
Messy and confusing. Older version was a better choice!¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨119

This app stops working often, making its file unavailable on my computers and Apple devices.¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨119
I’ve only been able to get a few things uploaded on here and then after I was done, I permanently deleted the ones I uploaded. Now I can’t seem to upload anymore stuff.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119
The new interface is impractical to navigate my hierarchy. Please give an option to default to the hierarchy view.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨119
I hate that the app will not let me preview a document before opening it in google slides or docs. Maybe I just want to see it first but nope not an option. then I have to close those apps and go back. then it changes the order my documents were in and I h¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨119

Cannot exit a video from full screen. I have to exit and restart app. Very frustrating. This is the same on two different iOS 11.4.1 devices. Also, PDF files are not supported. They must be downloaded to the device and read offline using a different app. O¨x¨¨x¨¨¨3¨119
Can’t save to camera roll now. Tapping and holding on the photo doesn’t bring up the menu anymore. Apple’s newest update bricked many apps. Many regrets.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨119

This app has so many good reviews I feel like they won’t even read mine, but a few things I will critique: - Could you bring back passcode lock?  - Can we have a scrollbar? - The new way our folders/files/pictures look makes it hard to see with the mobile¨x¨¨¨x¨¨3¨119

Would easily give it  5 stars. However, you cannot password protect a shared link to a folder. In this environment, it should be table stakes to password protect shared links. Why not Google?¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨119
This was a previously wonderful app that accomplished so many things. Five out of five. Then, for some reason, they eliminated the passcode lock. No more security. And worse if I sign into ANY Google product, all of them are activated. An idiotic move. Unb¨x¨¨x¨¨¨3¨119

Being a photographer, using google drive is an essential. I’ve been using this app four about five years now, and it’s been awesome!  Lately, these last few months, my phone can’t handle the app. It may be because I own an Iphone5 and it couldn’t handle t¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨119
I know they label dates but wish it automatically went to date folders, when loaded up. Please respond to this review and let me know how to make a folder again before I load.¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨119

On occasion the gps tracking is wracking and it thinks I am driving through a field. In addition the app makes assumptions about where you are turning and it makes it difficult to navigate correctly.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨22
I have to keep resetting the location and factory settings to vet it to recognize where i am. Iphone 6s plus with all the new updates.¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨22
I use google maps for everything and since this new update it doesn’t give me accuracy on anything. Not on the time it’ll take to get to my destination nor my location accuracy. Google PLEASE fix this.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨22
Crappy. Removed icons for transit, gave us tons of crappy ads. People, when you write reviews will you please discuss alternatives to maps?¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
it doesn’t tell me where all the cops are. and it doesn’t tell me how fast i am going.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
What’s going on with the last versions? I can’t even access the Commute tab anymore because I don’t have / don’t want to provide a work/school address. Still, I always used the Commute tab to check traffic conditions, but now Google Maps won’t allow me to ¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
The new update is a piece of crap, it doesn’t follow along with the road like it use to and it’s confusing to look at, it’s worse than the map app that comes on the iPhone now.¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨22
There&#39;s already Apple maps in every iPhone. I&#39;ve compared routes and travel time with both Google and Apple maps. They&#39;re the same thing. Honestly, people just rave about Google maps for silly reasons and swear by it but really lets be honest h¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨22
Google says I must use app to find directions. Then it says I can&#39;t download app because I already own it. It won&#39;t take me directly to the app I already own or allow me to just use the online version. So I have to pull my car over and copy and pas¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
Am I the only one who can’t see a single street line on their map after the update???? I can see street names, but there are no street lines visible at all.¨¨¨¨x¨¨1¨22
The recent addition of &#34;this route is clear&#34; has ruined my entire experience with maps. I need to remove this annoying pop up add as soon as possible. The pop up is redundant and an unwelcome addition to my screen. I have to acknowledge it to make ¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22

I do not want a game on my mapping app. If a game is needed I will download separately myself. What trash.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
I'm not sure what happened, but Maps is slow losses signal¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨22
There is a glitch where location *history is sensed by the app as being paused, it tells you it's paused, despite being 100% ON (upon checking the setting). Glitch started on Sunday 2/16, Android One OS phone.¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨22
This update has me lost. It does not follow my position as before.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨22
I worked here for 2 years . I delt with a million complaints . People always had the same complaint . It turned yellow or turned black . Stuff does not work on outdoor parts . It is pure garbage . They won’t send you a sample because they do not want you t¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨22

It is not working on my iPhone 6 when on data, it doesn&#39;t locate me properly it is off by half a mile¨¨x¨x¨¨¨1¨22
This software makes arbitrary &#34;corrections&#34; to your travel when you have set a route using specific roads with specific turns. Thanks for wrecking my morning.¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨22
Buggy and now missing highway exits in the directions.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
Super laggy in large populated areas, will change directions on you in a blink of an eye! Would not trust it much. Do you research before going on any trip.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨22
Honestly Google? F-You! Now I have to share my location everywhere I go, just to have a Home address set? You greedy, f-ing scum! You want to watch everything I do, just to use features that did not require them!! Sit and spin!!!!¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
There’s a bug on google street view where if I move around, the app goes black and stops working.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
You can no longer preview the routes before selecting one. You now have to try to tap on a tiny little line while avoiding all of the road closures, accidents, incidents, etc. PLEASE FIX!!!¨¨¨¨x¨¨1¨22
Latest app update breaks everything. Crashes during launch. DO NOT UPDATE!!!¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨22
Recently I left this app on in the background while using walking directions and it used over 6 GB of data within hours, with no warning. This app needs a data warning, cut-off, or data usage metering like the Netflix app recently implemented. Other than t¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
I rely heavily on a gps for daily commuting. Which means glancing at my map frequently to make sure I don&#39;t miss my turn. I can&#39;t do that if the maps are backwards because I make wrong turns. Probably my mistake but the map thing is hella inconveni¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
Until my voice prompts work again while the screen is locked, I will keep my rating at 1-star. This feature broke back when iOS 11 was introduced and has not been fixed since (currently now Dec 2019). I don’t understand how such an essential functionality ¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨22
I&#39;ve restarted my phone shut the app down and it still has me starting from a different area than I am in¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22

Won&#39;t work on older phones. Crashes almost immediately after opening app on my 4s. DO NOT UPDATE IF YOU HAVE AN OLDER PHONE!!!¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨22
They removed the MTA subway stops from the basic map view. It used to be so convenient to search a location and see which train stop is the closest to it. Now I have to use Apple’s map app.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
Worst response from app, navigation will not start immediately even after the journey is started¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
Only offers two-three routes which are very similar. Used to be able to drag route and edit it- would love that feature. Switched to Waze!! Yes Google Maps is the fastest but Waze offers routes that are better. For instance it&#39;s offing me a route a few¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
All the saved items are gone!  Way to go.  Who is getting fired over this update?¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨22
Nice¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨22
Wanted to use Google maps to suggest places and venues.  It only shows a map. No exploration¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
I am a Lyft driver and I have to close and restart this app about 5 times a day. It will get stuck on review route and there is no way out of the review mode accept for closing it. Switching apps because it frustrates passengers.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
Google maps has flaws: Not syncing my location to where I am in time for me to take the suggested turn. I hope updates work on it¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
This is usually my go to navigation app. But today the app was running a muck. After dropping a pin and attempting to navigate their the app sent me to a different address about a mile away from my destination. After typing in the address rather than dropp¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
Google has lost its edge in cartographic features in this app. They seem to have focused on points of interest!  I get it, that is the information most people want. But if you’re an old coot like me you cant read street or highway markers, no state borders¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
My wife and I dumped our iPhones for iPad Minis, primarily for the larger, easier-to-read screen. Unfortunately, this app. STILL doesn&#39;t use a larger text size when selected in Settings, (like Apple Maps does). We love Google Maps on our computers, sin¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
I used this for trips into NYC by public transportation but the public transport routing is no longer available. Please return that function!¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
Latest update said multiple stops could be added. There was no place to add a second destination. Instead the app over wrote the first destination when I tried to enter a second one. Map quest used to be able to do this. May have to check it out again.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
I HATE THIS NEW FORMAT!!!  All I want to do is open my app and put in the address I want and suddenly I’m FIGHTING TO JUST TO GET TO the navigation portion.   I don’t want you to give me EVENTS or places to follow.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨22
New update brought 3D Touch, but it doesn&#39;t work.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
With the latest update the voice navigation is no longer mute-able, it makes a really good app totally unusable for someone who listens to radio/music/podcasts from their phone while driving. Hopefully, that will be corrected in a future update.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
Map screen is to cluttered with buttons anymore, you cannot move the map around without accidentally opening something up. It’s just become more of a pain to use so I’ve moved on from google maps.¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨22
First of all, I like Google Maps as a mapping/nav application. However, I have two issues. The first issue is feature related--there needs to be the ability to view the map full screen in landscape mode when a pin has been dropped or a searched location ha¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
Google Maps use to be the best navigation tool you could have.  With the latest update it has taken a big step backward.  In planning navigation for the destination it will bring up your saved and labeled locations.  For picking your starting location it d¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨22
Been having a lot of issues with the app lately. The app will not let me go straight to the route and only gives a route preview. So the only way I can get the directions are to tap a button at each stop. This is super dangerous while driving and there is ¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
Satellite map images take very long to load even on LTE coverage. Please update!¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
I was trying to go to an event in a city I’m not very familiar with, and the app kept crashing on my iPhone. I ended up going through the Chrome browser to get directions. I Ben checked to make sure it was updated and it was. Not happy.¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨22
Add the ability to rename dropped pins from &#34;dropped pin&#34; which is totally useless, to something that will actually help us navigate!¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
Probably one of the top three apps I use on a daily basis and I&#39;m ready to actually use Apple Maps instead. Please allow one to mute the audio prompts.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
Created map on Windows 10 PC. The step by step matched the map view but the I sent to iPhone &amp; the directions were not as seen on PC view. Wanted to travel A1A &amp; it took me by I95. Map sent by email matched but not what was sent to phone.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
Please switch back to previous version  The old apps is easy to navigate in term of looking at all the photo just one tap and you can switch page to all photo. Now i have to tap photo button.  Sometimes too many buttons need also scrolling to the right, Th¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨22

Thank you Google maps for making us drive an extra 5 miles past our hotel for no reason. Overall maps helps but J.C. that was stupid.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
Slow running app. Too bloated.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
Google maps used to be one of the better designed iOS apps out there. Unfortunately, the shift in design philosophy has either removed features, or hidden them away in weird places. The lack of persistent UI in the new look seriously hurts usability. If G¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨22
Keeps freezing after a few minutes. I need to close app and start again.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
Get rid of the &#34;similar ETA&#34; and go back to displaying the delay or faster time in actual minutes. I drive all day long with this app running in the background, and if that&#39;s not changed, I will delete this app. Until the latest update, I LOVE ¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
The new update sucks. What happened to showing the time remaining in the trip and the miles in the bottom of the screen. Also when you clicked on that before it brought up details you can choose from. You need to bring back those options¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
Used to be good , stopped being reliable over a year ago! Blue dot is almost always off to the side of where I actually am, on a different (INCORRECT) road. It’s a good thing I have to use paper maps and hand written instructions for work (often in remote ¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
This app used to be awesome because it was so specific that it would tell you even how to get into the parking lot of your specific location. But now it only tells you whether it&#39;s on the right or left, which is not helpful because it times it will tak¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
For the longest time all my saved places showed up on my map and now nothing.  I’ve tried signing in and out, deleting the app and downloading it again and for a split second everything shows up and then it disappears.  Help me with this someone!!!¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
It&#39;s really bad at giving proper navigation in urban areas.  Especially in the greater NYC area.  Instructing you to be in the wrong lanes causes lots of headaches.   Route selection is also getting worse and is inconsistent.  Depending on the day it ¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
It still has the same issues from the 5.3 version =(¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨22
The new update is good but the only lack i am experiencing is that whenever i take a turn as it says me to turn, before the turn the arrow is in my destination's direction but after the turn it changes the direction and points towards me though the discrip¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
Very important¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨22
In version 5.10. After starting directions to a destination, if you click on the option to view the route on the map (the thing that looks like 2 arrows point up next to each other), you are unable to go back to the directions or go anywhere. You have to c¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
This app only works when you have wifi which is really inconvenient when on the road! Only map app I use and it never fails to make me frustrated because it takes ages to load!¨x¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
Every time I start my route it force closes. I uninstalled and reinstalled and still closes. I use this app every day to go to work and it failed me today. Please fix asap!¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
I have always loved this app until this new update. First they took away the step by step process when you are walking and this has made if very confusing to follow the directions. Also, they have messed with the timing and made it confusing. Please fix th¨x¨¨¨x¨¨2¨22
It works for searching a place but crashes if you try to use any other feature¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
I used to swear by Google Maps but it’s now so glitchy that it’s a pain to use. I still love being able to check reviews on places and find nearby businesses but man this thing messes up a lot now. They messed it up trying to make it better with updates!¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
This application is good but not accurate especially when I choose roads without tolls¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
Since the update it keeps losing the GPS location please fix¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
Every time I put in a location and want to transit, google says “can’t find a way there” when I know you can take the train. This is a bug or something but needs to be fixed soon.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
It’s good for when you’re walking and driving, but what about transit? What it used to be able to do is show me the route I can take using the trains and buses, but now all that shows up is “can’t find a way there, try again” every time I go to search a wa¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨22
Soy (era) leal usuario de la aplicación hasta que tuve que cambiar de Android a IOS y me percaté que en IOS no existe la opción driving mode que sí está disponible en Android. Muy mal por google.¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨22

I think this new updated is affecting the issue with my google maps. After I&#39;ve set my destination the application would close and I am no longer in direction. 😞¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨22
Too bad doesn&#39;t work with car play on iPhone¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨22
Worked great, no glitches and no complaints until a month or 2 ago when I finally updated the app. Started experiencing problems like the app freezing up and various other things so I&#39;ve been constantly keeping an eye out for updates but with each new ¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨22
New update is messing up...gps can&#39;t tell if I made a turn or not, nor can it tell if I am on highway or side road. It was just perfect before...seems like a big was added not removed..thanks for the great work tho¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨22
It works but it draws more power from my phone and drains my battery more than any other app. Not even close. Phone even becomes less responsive while the app is running.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨22
This app will take you down the fastest and tightest roads it is not good for CDL driving when you are in big trucks there are no options to enter heights or restrictions on vehicles so we can plan a better path for you I do not recommend if you are drivin¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
Keep up the great work!¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨22
I have an iPhone 5s. The App does not show up in notifications. It is there on my iPad, was there on my 4s, and it&#39;s on my wife&#39;s iPhone 6.¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨22
I like how whenever I sit still in my bed and check my location, the little blue dot is out on the road in front of my house. Actually, I don’t like that.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨22
The Google map certainly has its pros and cons, but I e con that needs serious improvement is its print size. The section at the top where it provides the actual directions is way too small to read when your phone is mounted on the dash. Google should ma¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
This App is bad with construction areas and always says that traffic is good.  Want real time?  Use something else¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
The gps icon for map needs to be 3D iPhone compatible, I want to use 3D To go from changing the map size when I zoom.  And car location saver for when you on the go that fast to use  That works with the camera to grab location and map service.¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨22
Need to find poi easier, restaurants, gas stations easier ,   by easier to find icons¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨22
Please add an option to always avoid toll roads. It&#39;s dangerous when I start the maps and I have to maneuver through the settings to select avoid tolls. There should already be a permanent setting to avoid this.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
The Koh Tao Thailand maps are not up to date.  We need to get a google car here to map this island. Thanks¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
While driving we need to know where gas stations are that have diesel gas.  Would it be possible to indicate that by the nearby gas stations it shows?¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
The new update makes it difficult to download offline maps. Cannot update too.¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨22
Waze is better and Google And merges with ways to improve customer experience¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨22
It would even be better if you are able to find places along the route you are navigating while navigating it.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
Better than Google by far.  Offline mode downloadable and much better than Google.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
Since I upgraded, the voice navigation keeps disappearing and nothing I do brings it back. Worst of all, the app seems to be having a problem locating me. It keeps placing my position 2 to 3 blocks away from where I am. Also, the app seems to be completely¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨22
This app badly needs the ability to slide aside the informational sidebar once a location has been found and the map is displayed. The iPad mini loses 40% of the map display area to the sidebar showing a picture and description of the destination. Give me ¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨22

Why google is not updating new addresses more often, mostly new developed community? My community developed 9 months ago but map has not updated yet.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
Love the app except wish it would track a route and record it, I can&#39;t figure out if or how to do that¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
The explore tab takes up to much screen real estate. There should be a setting to disable it. Personally when I open maps I would like to see map screen and a search bar at the top top or bottom of the page and nothing else. It’s currently to cluttered and¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨22
I used Google maps often until they took away the street view. Why ruin a good thing? Please bring it back!¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
Going south on a strange street,  the vehicle direction is down (geographic south). As a result, a right turn appears as one to the left. Confusing and dangerous. I had to start Apple Maps upgrading to three stars after the information about how to switc¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨22
Dear Google, Absolutely love the app in terms of directions but it is extremely painful when I want to zoom out on my route using the two finger pinch method and your app automatically zooms back in to the route. This auto zooming behavior prevents me fro¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨22
Why Google would you have me go 3 miles out the way instead of taking a direct route which would&#39;ve had me there 10 minutes earlier¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨22

Usually cannot get specific route I want to take, for example going around a major city instead of through it, I have to resort to setting way points which takes a lot of work and thought, I Find it amazing the trouble this app will go through to force you¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨22
Apple watch version missing¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨22
Maps use to never do this but now when you start it takes a long time for it to know where you’re pointed and tell you to go the wrong way from the start and it can add some time to your trip. In addition it’s been more confusing lately about what routes t¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨22
Original locations.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨22
Liked some of the previous incarnations better but this, still, is the best map ap. Navigation have some great features, telling me what lane to take before turns is priceless and greatly increase safety (for both users and drivers within their vicinity). ¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
I was excited for see when Google updated their maps and show the bus navigation. The problem is that the bus times are way off especially the express buses. For instance it will say a bus is coming at 4:25, it will show that it arrived and even where it w¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨22
It&#39;s a cool App but it&#39;s missing something¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨22
Sad to see maps not navigating anymore, this app just isn&#39;t as good...¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
Note to developers: Location sharing feature is great for sharing my commute home with family for safety and ETA. With new version updates it’s been glitchy, having a spinning wheel trying to start.  If we could make it easier to share instead of exiting ¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨22
It’s not updated with construction closers and reopenings  on freeway and interstate lanes or exits… it’s very slow to update traffic flow while en route. It’s not updated on new traffic signs put in place that have been there for at least a month. Please ¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22
I would like to star all the Walmarts at once for an area. Could I have an option to do that with other chains? Or maybe star all libraries at once?¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨22

It&#39;s a good app. I like that you can add stops along the way for things like coffee and gas. I do not like that there is a &#34;1&#34; bubble on the app signaling that I have a notification, but I can&#39;t find that notification in the app.¨¨¨¨x¨¨4¨22
Title represents my opinion on this app.  Very comparable to Apple Maps.   Sure wish all the Google Apps didn’t feed data into each other though!  Makes me not want to have them on my iPhone.  I got used to the Google Platform on my last phone (Android). ¨x¨¨x¨¨¨4¨22
It works great!!¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨22
.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨22
Needs offline map download like here maps, especially for overseas travel.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨22
Gud¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨22
It needs to be refined just a little. The first couple versions were very good.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨22
Somehow I now have a pink Pacman character on my screen that can&#39;t get rid of . Any ideas ?¨¨¨¨x¨¨4¨22
Map accurate. Easy to use. Find many a village to plunder. Thor be praised!!!¨¨x¨¨x¨¨4¨22
Works well most of the time.¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨22
I have a love-hate relationship with Maps. It is usually reliable, but sometimes provides less than optimum routes. Specifically, on the highway, it sometimes tells you to exit to surface streets, which sometimes might be faster. But it only takes one or t¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨22
An amazing app i couldn’t live without. But because i can’t live without it and use it so much, it’s extremely frustrating to encounter the same design flaw almost every time i use it. I want to search from my current location. Not from where i was the las¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨22
As suggested cleared cache but still app crashing especially when clicking on bottom tab during navigation to see directions, swiping up works but sometimes it also crashing app. After disabling assess to music it’s working like charm. Looks like iOS 13 co¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨22
Great app, much better than the default Apple maps - I just wish that Google Earth was combined with this as one program to free up space. Anyways, the accuracy is amazing and always has the most updated maps.¨x¨x¨¨¨¨4¨22
This app transitions well, but it needs to provide better options.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨22
The Best¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨22
Amazing features but it always crashes after 10 to 15 minutes  Also pictures not showing up¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨22
Very helpful¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨22
Since the update I have not been able to save multiple locations i.e. favorites when you hit the star it acts like it will turn gold but it goes back to blue¨x¨¨¨x¨¨4¨22
Excellent app that for some reason stops working here in the United Arab Emirates. There are days when the app simply seizes up - or literally goes &#34;haywire&#34; simply not showing the way and not locating properly. Not sure if the network operators ca¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨22
Good.  Helpful¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨22
It cool¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Good app¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
I really enjoy using this app. It&#39;s my main go-to app for directions, but when I&#39;m trying to look up a route it wants to snap back to your current location. I know some people like to blindly follow their GPS, but I prefer to study my route before ¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
Great travel aid. Uses local transportation like as buses, trains, ferry as a mode of travel. Walking or by car as a alternate aid getting to your destination. Pretty accurate and you get a preview of your destination to get a idea of the lay of the land. ¨¨x¨¨¨¨5¨22
Fantastic!¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Been using google map for a long time, I just love how easy it is in giving me directions.¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
I'd give this app 6/5 if I could, I can't even begin to count how many times this treasure has saved me time and effort, it's a life saver¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Better than external GPS!¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
This app  is grate you go it have!!¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Nice Very good¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
I use this with confidence every day for work.¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
I love this app!¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
I don&#39;t always drive and when I&#39;m visiting another city I use this app to find public transportation and it has always work!¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
I love this app. Amazing app. I use it to navigate, explore, and save places I’ve been to. I’d recommend google maps to everyone.¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
Excellent¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Great traveling companion 😀Logan 11noah12¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
For google save me a lot of time¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Nice¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Have been using this app for many years and is hands down the best GPS app out there.¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Great app. I feel this is much better the the Apple maps app.¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Good¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
See title¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
We have been using it for three days. Very impressive!  Excellent in all regards.¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Love it!  It is always correct and reliable!¨x¨x¨¨¨¨5¨22

Nice¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Love this app¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Excellent¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Great program¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
I like it!¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Google maps is THE BEST in the world. All the other maps not even close.¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Good to use...¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Like it¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22

I am overwhelmed with this app because I navigate by hearing so it's needed some more precision like at the edge of round- bound and every small turning with Simon tenuous two way roads navigation and for your information KOLKATA traffic one way reverse at¨¨x¨¨¨¨5¨22
Happy¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
So it seems to that the wonky time schedule for the public transportation section is working again as it should. So as a woman of my word, I&#39;m changing back my rating. So far looks like everything is back in tip top shape. Hopefully it stays this way.¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
ممتاز وسهل👍🏾¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Most useful app on my phone!¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
شكراً لكم على هذا البرنامج الرائع والمفيد ❤️👍¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Our road we live on is wrong on google maps¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
I think that goggle maps is good too have as a app i don’t care what you have to say about goggle maps it’s a map¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Excellent Service to use it gives me the fastest route. Helps me avoid heavy traffic, let&#39;s me know when I&#39;m approaching a scene of an accident or getting close to a construction zone. Thumbs up Google!!   (:¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
Good app.¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
Excellent service¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
I only wish while navigating to show the next route right away. Pittsburgh has very short exits and if I do not exactly  what it is the next step it makes me anxious.¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
C&#39;est parfaittt¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
I don&#39;t know what I would do without Google Maps. It&#39;s so helpful. Thank you google.¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨22
I prefer this app to others I&#39;ve used so far. I can choose not to go through tolls and I it recommends alternative and shorter routes¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
Lacks nothing I&#39;d need in the browser version.¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨22
After the most recent update, it has been really annoying keeps asking for my name and password. I have to sign in after every click. If it continues I will uninstall and use another alternative.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
EVERY time I try to use this app it says “connection error.” I don’t have any problems with any of my other apps not being able to connect. It’s very aggravating.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨118
This app will not let me upload my resumé in ANY job for which I'm applying. Uninstalling. Very disappointing.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
One of worst app¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
i dont even think they send in the apps anymore i use to get jobs quick on here even with a background now it seems like indeed doesnt work for those with records¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
Most recent update (as of 11/16/19) makes the app virtually unusable.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
All of these jobs and no one is calling me back for an interview and I have 24 years of experience.¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
No response from employees, better walk up to places. It’s faster than indeed 100x faster.¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
Not sure what's wrong with this app I can no longer access my resume or update it or do anything but send old resumes and read occasional messages but can't access any links in them and also there are other listings like from the job bank which I also cant¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
Cant open it as the app shows my connectivity is down, but in reality my internet connectivity is up and running smoothly and also my other apps (using thetl same connection)..dont known why your app is behaving like this.?¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨118
It was better before recent update!¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
It bugs out so much and I don’t get notifications and somehow it deleted my resume¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨118
A lot of false advertising of positions¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
Every time I open the app I have to log back in. It is beyond frustrating.¨¨¨¨x¨¨1¨118
Ever since updating indeed app I can’t click on or view more information about the jobs! Only able to see the title of the job ! needs to be fixed!!¨¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
Always connection error.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨118
I have never received a follow up on any of the jobs I’ve EVER applied for on here! One manager even told me that companies don’t always get the Indeed apps online. So what’s the point in using apps like this?¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
Asking for money for providing job..this much charges you have to pay security charges etc...¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
Doesn't matter what you search it never gives you what you want¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
I am a veteran, recently retired, excellent driving record and absolutely no criminal history. I have applied on Indeed over the past few months for a variety of jobs from entry level to advanced positions, both part-time and full-time. I have received ONE¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
Since the update on 11/5/19 I can no longer click on jobs I’m interested in 🤦🏽‍♀️.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
What’s the point of having this app if it won’t keep you logged in, and when you TRY to log back in, it won’t recognize your log in!¨¨x¨¨x¨¨1¨118
Usually I don’t experience any problems but today indeed has been acting up 90^ of the time. I can’t go to the next page and when I can it won’t load ! Fix!!¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨118
I hate it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
Too many fake jobs.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
I received a job offer through indeed to my email and it turned out to be a scam. I was about to even deposit a fraudulent check into my bank in order to be a “personal assistant.” Googled to see if there was anyone else and apparently there’s plenty of ot¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
App won't let me log in. Whenever I press sign in, the app just reloads. I can't save a job to my list either. Needs an update.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
This App seems to work great in other states.  Not sure if California employers just don&#39;t contact back or if the majority of the jobs being posted are scams.  I&#39;ve even look the company up before applying and some are not even existing companies. ¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
Something's wrong with the indeed. I've been using it since then but since November 2019, I wasn't able to sign in. Will rate it 5 stars when it's fixed.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
Here fill your resume out. Now put that info in every application. I check and make sure it’s 10 questions and then I’m 40 questions in filling out 5 most recent jobs WHEN ITS ALL IN MY RESUME. Give me auto fill.¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
Horrible. I've been using Indeed for years & it's crazy that such a simple website could have such issues. While normally functioning, I would rather just use Chrome to access Indeed. But several times without so much as a maintenance warning (this is conj¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
Ever since the last update for IOS you are unable to open any job.¨x¨¨x¨¨¨1¨118
I have applied to 100 jobs on here not 1 Interview, not 1!!!  Also, I plug in pharmacist and I get nurse job, optometrist, techs, etc. and some pharmacist jobs¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
Can not access job info - point and click not working on iPhone.¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨118
There aren’t any real jobs on this site.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
So I just graduated with my BA and I’m searching for the keyword “bachelor” because I want a professional position but when I search for this keyword I get so many RN or STEM positions that it makes the job search so time consuming. Why has no one thought ¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
This application is not helpful in anyway. I have not found not a single solid job from Indeed. I get recommendation messages to apply and never get any reply. Businesses and recruiters never respond or just waste your time.¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
Why this app is not showing messages?¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
The jobs I want are never available the worst part is trying to start over in another area and can get the job your looking for just a waste of time¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
Please do not show jobs that they have already applied for.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
Only sends suggestions for current industry. which was a just a job to finish my 4 year degree.  This is useless if your trying to find a new career.  Unless you want to be an insurance agent¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
I have been using indeed for 2 years now, and have only had one response from employers.  I keep getting all of these tags that people have viewed my resumé but have yet to have any responses.¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
Constantly signs me out after every time I apply¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨118
The app is great but the problem is the employers not reaching out after you have applied. I have applied to over 100 jobs in the past month and a half and gotten 0 calls And this isn’t jobs out of my level of expertise these are jobs I’m very qualified fo¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
App used to be great, now it’s garbage. When I click on a job listing I either get a list of previous searches or the info from a previously viewed listing.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
Up until a few days ago, I have had no problem using the app. All of a sudden, nothing worked right. My resume won’t load when applying, and half the time won’t even allow me to click on a job listing to see it in detail. It just freezes, and that’s all. T¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨118
Seems like my age works against me. Same jobs get posted and I apply and no contact of any kind is initiated. If it’s not my age why are the same jobs not getting filled.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
i always give one star when solicited for reviews¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨118
This is trash, it won’t accept any of my new passwords to sigh in even after I changed them multiple times. This was a waste of time.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨118
Constantly logs me out, removes my searches and crashes. That last update just broke this app.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨118
Most job offers aren’t mobile friendly.¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨118
Too many 3rd Party emails &amp; spam mail. I’m deleting .¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
Search results dont match. When job is removed an says it wont show up in the future it shows up the very next time the app is opened.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨118
Ok¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
The new update/layout of the app is messy and cheap. The job constantly repeat on the list and it’s so messed up confusing and disorganized I can’t use it anymore. All my jobs I’ve found thru this app and now I have to find somewhere else hoping to find an¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨118
First, there’s no way to get support. Secondly, the fricking annoying pop ups “do you want to fill with indeed resume” while applying to some jobs must stop immediately! If I click NO once then why do you insist on asking the same fricking question over an¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
It’s a good app for looking for work. But theirs a lot of staffing agency’s posting jobs they don’t even have which gets annoying if you’re really looking for work. Indeed doesn’t seem to do anything about it.¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
Asking to login again and again¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
When I search for jobs in a specific location, it would be nice not to be shown jobs, you know, 3 hours away. Purely because they are sponsored.  I could care less about those. And why doesn’t distance settings become default. Why does it always default t¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
Since updating, I can’t open any job opportunities to research their offer or apply if I like it.  Please fix this as I am currently actively seeking employment and I am unable to open any job listings. When I click on the job NOTHING HAPPENS.  Please he¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
My resume CLEARLY shows management experience and yet your system doesn’t show. Good work!!¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
Like but when you put in the town you want to work only that town it gives you locations that are 30 miles from the location you want to work even when I put in exact location¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨118
The search option keeps telling me to check my internet connection when my connection is fine.¨x¨x¨¨¨¨2¨118
Lately It’s Just Been Scams Contacts Me Off Of Indeed And It’s Super Annoying . Contacting Me Like Their A Real Job ...¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
Apply to many jobs here but need to have reminders for the employers to contact via email for a update status or a requirement to check applications once a week? Something for the employers I get about 5-10 emails a day from your site.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
Amazing¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
Why are recommended jobs showing none when it says I have 70+. Hit the recommended and it says no jobs¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨118
I’m in Chicago but majority of the jobs are not in my area. It’s really annoying¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
I would prefer job offers more specific to my particular matches. For example, do not show me jobs that require me being bilingual. Or jobs outside of Miami...¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
There is a 50/50 chance that the job description won't match my requests, the same job could fall under many and/or out of my area or state.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
You should go to the company your applying to directly. I have applied to dozens of positions on this app only to hear back from perhaps 4 or 5. Not sure what they are doing with your info but it doesn’t seem to go to employers.¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
Too many pop up windows, asking you to answer the same questions over and over again.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
👎🏽¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
How am I supposed to apply when the app keeps shutting down¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨118
Used to work now it’s useless fix it!!!!¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
No job yet it’s been 3 years using this search engine¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
For whatever reason with the last update, I am no longer able to click on the job to get more information or to apply. It just does nothing. Please fix. I used to love you all for job searching, but I can’t even use it any more.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
Meh¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
App is constantly making me sign in even when I just signed in. I also have to keep uploading my resume even though it's saved in there.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
I’ve been using this app for 8 months now.I pick through “weeds” to find positions that match what positions I’m searching for.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
I have rated this app two Stars because looking for work is easier but they keep recommending jobs that I'm not qualified for or jobs I have never done that require certifications if it's not those there's a lot of temp agencies they do have some really go¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
I am just so frustrated at the fact that I can’t even see the job details anymore. Yes the option for me to delete offers is pretty nice but I don’t even know what I would be favoriting or deleting if I can’t even open up the details. Before it had this up¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
While searching my email notifications I go to click on the job I’m interested in. the app open but freezes and doesn’t open the job. I have 20 plus notifications for messages in my inbox but I have read them already. Plus, I can’t delete them.¨x¨x¨¨¨¨2¨118
Not too great. Learning to get inteviews scheduled on this app is not the easiest.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨118
App is poorly designed, difficult to navigate, and not as effective as the website.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨118
I did like 25 application. Not one called me or message me  its good to tell u whats Accepting  Applications but you should do it the old-fashioned way 😪👎👎👎¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
The app is haveing problems. Can’t even log into my account. Serious problem when communicating with employers¨x¨x¨¨¨¨2¨118
Just wondering why there are no language settings like to keep english language for all countries. If I want to search for a job in a specifoc country everything goes in that country's language.....¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
Garbage app, routinely won’t allow you to clear “new” from the criteria so even when you do it just shows only the new job, not the other 458 jobs. Stop fixing what isn’t broken!!¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨118
I haven’t really been hearing back from employees¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
No calls and jobs too spotty, requires too much distance, you don't work with those with disabilities.¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
The app needs to be updated with better graphics and catchier look! Just bland¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨118
The Recent Searches list cuts off at the past 10 searches. History before that is lost. It should be much longer. My potential fits span many titles and various locations, and exceeds the 10 recent searches that are shown.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
So if you are searching for “sailboat captain” you will find jobs for Oil Tanker Mechanic and etc... No way to do searches within searches like Craigslist has been able to do for decades. Seems like searches have been getting more opaque than even 6 months¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
Since this last update, when I try to open the indeed app it immediately crashes. I’m going to try deleting and reinstalling the app. But it’s annoying¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨118
When I click search script error happens where the keyboard disappears and doesn’t let me search rather use my noble browser¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨118
Why can’t I just upload my resume. I know, you can “upload” a resume into indeed but I can’t just upload the .pdf that I typed up myself. Why?  As well I will search for a Jr. software developer and get Sr. Developer jobs. I’m not sure what the hang up is¨x¨x¨¨¨¨2¨118
Recent update now logs me off, when I log in deletes my searches and keeps happening.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨118
Most of the employees didn't review the applications at all. Applied for more then 10 jobs, only 2 employers viewed application but no news after that.¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨118
Only user friendly for employees not employers. Used to be able to use it as an employer now I cant even navigate to my posted jobs or see my candidates that have applied. UNINSTALLED.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨118
It takes ages for messages etc to ping through. I missed out on a potential job as I didn't get the message till an hour later. Messages also don't update properly and doesnt show sent messages¨x¨x¨¨¨¨3¨118
Since I have learned about Indeed I have never been job less since And the easy apply part I love¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
Not good not bad¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
Generally, the app is great for what it is.   Filters though should really be advanced requiring employers to be more specific about roles and allowing applicants to better target opportunities.  This is especially true for salary ranges - I understand wh¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
I have been a member of indeed for over a year now. I have many experiences in Healthcare and Customer Services. I have applied to over a hundred jobs so far and have only had about 6 interviews. I don’t know if my applications are being submitted or not b¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
Ever since you guys updated the app all I been having is problems. I love it but tired of it just staying on one screen and can’t apply to a lot of jobs.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
It’s ok so far, just waiting to see some results. However it is rather user friendly, and has a message tab so it won’t get lost in my email.¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨118
I'm not getting any single interview from this site I applied lot from this site no response from any concern¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
It’s been hard for me to find a job no one contacts you back¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
Helpfull¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
Great app to use. Easy to update resume within it. The only problem I have it logs me out of the app if I close it. I have to type my email and password in every time I use the app. Other job apps don’t do that.  There should be an option to keep me signed¨x¨x¨¨¨¨3¨118
Wonderfull app indeed¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
I been trying to fill out application but when I comes to the part asking how many Year been doing this I answer but it say I did not answer this needs fix because of that I’m giving 3 stars¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
Needs more jobs that are able to utilize a rapid apply system instead of them detouring users to their site where it takes a couple extra hours to complete when your short on time as is.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
I was able to get interviews from this sight, but I feel like Indeed should try harder when notifying the employers of potential employees.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
A lot of companies don’t respond and a lot of old posts still.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
I liked this app, but all of a sudden they’re showing every job as new. So I now have 6k+ jobs to look through even though I was checking this app daily.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
I searched some of the jobs according to my qualification but i saw there is no contact details or incorrect number sometimes i faced many problems like they demanded charges between 20 to 40 thousand. Tell me if i am not working right now then how can i g¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
The filters DO NOT WORK! I put in 5 miles and it gives me things 20+ miles away!¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
The search function is clunky and difficult to filter relevant results. Keyword searching, exclusion searching, and excluding jobs without a salary would go a long way to improving the experience, as well as more sort options.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
This great to get job but I have one pr my iPhone xs max gets very hot when using the app just after a few minutes¨¨x¨x¨¨¨3¨118
Only hiccups I am experiencing are: 1. Inability to see a complete conversation in Message Tab via mobile. 2. After confirming interest, logging in is hard to do. Other than that, I love this app.¨x¨¨¨x¨¨3¨118
Sometime I have problem downloading my resume on indeed¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
Usually works great but recently it keeps logging me out, forcing me to revise my search query.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨118
appp is slow in working it lags¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨118
The jobs doesn’t have exactly location, zip code isn’t enough.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
I’m not sure when it changed, but sorting by date posted (ie most recent) is now broken...which is obnoxious as that feature used to be one of the most useful. Basically, it means there’s absolutely no point in using that app at all... Also, allow us to t¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
This app is great except the jobs they suggest for you never match up to your resume¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
Website is way better then the app¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
Good app¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
Love this app but I have been frustrated since I can’t filter my results. I can’t even separate old postings from new ones. Maybe I am missing where that is done on the app but, I am positive that I cannot find it.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
I’ve gotten all my previous jobs from this website and now the app won’t let me sign in and load my resume? It is getting quite irritating as my resume is on there and I don’t want to remake one and it won’t let me sign in to download it. Please fix?¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
Fix your app it would not let me to apply or save anything¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
Ooo¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
calls from recruiters is urgently required¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
The app itself is a good idea, however it would be better if all companies listed their pay rates and exact job descriptions. I have applied to a couple where the job listed wasn't what they were hiring for. There should also be a requirement for companies¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
Its great to find jobs but no one calls for a interview but maybe its me¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118

Works but needs tweaked. resume section glitches¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨118
Doesn’t refresh as well as the Android version. Lots of jobs are well over 30 days old and I’m sure filled. Overall though a decent app.¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨118
I can’t open any jobs from the app anymore, it just turns blue. I tried looking through the support page but found no resolution or topics relating to this issue.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
So far I’ve applied for a number of jobs but that’s about it¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
Easy,simple and stress free as long as u have data you can apply any time any where i love it ,it makes life easy .¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨118
Very good application,but unfortunately is not good for myself.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨118
Simple app. Not many interactive filters. My MAIN request is to filter jobs with the &#34;apply with your indeed resume&#34; tab that way we can apply as fast as possible and skip all that other stuff .¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
Update does not let me click on the job and apply.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118
Difficult to use the app on the new iPad Pros. Would be great if the app was updated to work on them.¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨118
I love the app it's very helpful. I just wish the app and site would stop referring jobs to me that's out of my area. If I put the location as Philadelphia then that's what I what to see. Please specify where these jobs are located. If it's in another part¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨118

When I try to use OneNote on my Apple Watch I keep getting a message saying I should sign into OneNote on my iPhone. But I signing out and into OneNote on the iPhone doesn&#39;t help. I still can&#39;t use OneNote on my Apple Watch. This is a big disappoin¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨71
Umm for some stupid reason it's not working anymore so...¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨71
Constant issues with sign in¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
Usually OneNote is great. But this version only crashes. I&#39;ve tried reinstalling and clearing everything from settings. Hopefully it&#39;s patched soon¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨71
How can you consider this app anywhere near complete without the option to convert handwriting to text? How this is not the number one feature request, is beyond me.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
If the file has photos or anything other than Text forget syncing it with your phone¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨71
No scanning, diminished features, no support. Just give it up and let Evernote have the space.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
I have been using the app throughout medical school. Almost all of my notes and work have been saved to a onedrive account. I have had numerous issues with the program being buggy in the past which I understand is not completely avoidable. But I recently w¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨71
Good¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨71
Its okay for mobile but wish MS would bring back the desktop version back to windows instead of this trash. Less stable and fewer features.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
Your app won't even present my google keyboard for me to type with. Fix this. It would freeze the typing monitor, I wouldn't have any way of typing.¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨71
"When i share something from another app its says ""plz open OneNote app and set it up for note sharing"", i did all possible things but not work, I really love OneNote, fix it and I'll give 5 star. I need sticky note widget too."¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
Cant even change font size.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
Terrible editing options. Can't even create another row in a table.¨¨¨¨x¨¨1¨71
Lost my 3-years notes when I changed my phone. There's no way to recover them. Very dissappointing!¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
Had my phone stolen.  Got new iPhone and went to sign in.  Hasn&#39;t let me access any of my notes despite accepting my sign in.  Can&#39;t chat with them and they don&#39;t return emails.¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨71
Microsoft’s utterly BONEHEAD move to eliminate notebook storage anywhere but OneDrive is a dealbreaker!   Reasons for local storage:  private data, archives, backups.  Take away the ability to keep data privately, to keep archives, and have local backups ¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
Keyboard STILL doesn't work! Having decided to try and use Onenote for all note taking I've been under whelmed. Firstly the keyboard doesn't appear making it useless on the phone. It's slow, takes forever to sync. Options for making tables are limited. I c¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨71
It&#39;s frustrating as many times specially when I do not have cell phone data coverage or wifi looses my updates¨x¨x¨¨¨¨1¨71
I used to have the option to change the mathematical equations I write into text and now that is gone. I’m very disappointed. It’s buggy too. Sometimes when I first try to use my Apple Pencil after opening the app it won’t respond.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71

The whole point of one note is taking notes. I take notes go back to my desk and they are gone!¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
Pathetic app. As soon as you try to sign in with the app some unexpected error will be shown. And inspite of sending feedback and requesting the customer service no one is replying. Soo pissed off.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨71

I am getting frustrated as this app is crashing a lot. I am using it on iPad 12.1.2. Please fix the bugs I need to prepare notes and bring it to classes.¨¨x¨x¨¨¨1¨71
severely limited when compared to its ios/iPados counter part, needs more development having 500 million + downloads should make you people more enthusiastic to refine and add more features to this app and its not even difficult you have already got the eq¨x¨¨x¨¨¨1¨71
Once I open the app, it sits on the main page and says loading page. I can&#39;t tap anything, and nothing will load. I tried closing out the app, deleting and re-downloading, and signing out and signing in. Nothing works. Fix and maybe I&#39;ll use it.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨71
This app WOULD be great if it actually saved my work. How useless. I&#39;ve noted all kinds of things down (or so I thought) only to come back to find my notes never saved. What a joke. Back to the original notes it is.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
It's giving me lots of problems and glitching when I try typing in it.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
This application i use it on laptop as well !! Problem with this is it dont sync properly !! Whatever books i hv created names are not coming properly !! Book title is not sync properly !!¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71

I’m using an iPad Air running IOS 12.4.5. One Note won’t open pages or update pages.¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨71
I downloaded this app today.  I tried to create an account using my email address and it indicated I already have an account. There is no option to recover a password.  There is only the option to create an account with a new email address or phone number ¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
ALWAYS some kind of page conflict. ALWAYS dropping the last bit of what you write. You tell me there is a page conflict on my PHONE but I need to open the app in a BROWSER to fix it. Come in Microsoft, this is beyond sad.¨¨¨¨x¨¨1¨71
It has become very clear what Microsoft has done to strangle as much money from you as possible and making you have to use their cloud based software on IOS and Mac in order to view or look at files. Using their ecosystem. You cannot export pdf files in On¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
I can't even get past the first screen. I already have a onenote account (for school) but it doesn't give the option to log in, only to sign up, and when I put in my school email it tells me to go back to the first screen and log in.¨¨¨¨x¨¨1¨71
Can't fix conflicts inside the app?!¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
It is terrible at syncing between devices¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨71
Microsoft product, just don't like it.¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨71
So frustrating. I use this app a lot and it crashes randomly and loses data. Going to another notes app until Microsoft can get this resolved.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨71
Could be great, but constant trouble with syncing.  Constant trouble without being able to empty its&#39; recycle bin.  Never any reply for help in over a year.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
Works fine on iPhone but does not work on Apple Watch! Please Microsoft fix this issue!!!¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨71

The fact that MS has not been able to resolve the proofing issue with the language settings is annoying.  For anyone that knows multiple languages this issue seems to be enough to drop OneNote and look for alternatives. Quick search results in any search e¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨71
App keeps crashing unexpectedly at the same time as syncing occurs. App-breaking issue. Continues to crash every 20-30 min. Functions moderately, new update does not allow for selection of default pen sizes. Not a great app.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
I was really excited to use this app for grad school.  I open it, love its set-up, love the way it works, start putting in notes and BAM! Slows to the speed of a slug taking downers.  I was, to say the least, very disappointed.  It&#39;s slow, painfully sl¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
So I have a 256GB iPad Pro 10.5 and while OneNote for iPad has all the features that I need, I get ridiculous lag when using my Smart Keyboard. The arrow keys cause the cursor to lock up for 5+ seconds and it is very, very unresponsive. It seems that it al¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨71
This app crashes all the time when pasting images or text into a shared, onedrive notebook.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
It's great at organizing but it needs to be better at supporting typing. Also, its be nice for a change font option.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨71
"Does not work well. Does not sync with ""one drive"""¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
Use it frequently so it’s decently robust. Run into sync issues and there are glitches that bother me in the iOS version. Also missing some crucial features¨¨x¨x¨¨¨2¨71
I like to organize everything in my Onenote and I just bought an iPad Pro 12 inch 2017 Just for onenote app Because all my Work in this note and i like to use Table 90% of my work in onenote and the ipad Version is useless with table Options and there is n¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨71

Quite often won't open and you never know if you have lost your notes.....¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
Exllent¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨71
I don't like the recent notes as the first thing I see when I open the app. I want to see my folders first. I also echo others regarding the lack of the features found on the dedicated windows version. Like Evernote but hate their charges so Onenote is way¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨71
Can only open few notes from onenote windows. Cannot open large data notes¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
not being ungrateful, but how long does it take to have a stable version of this app.  inam on highspeed internet and still syncing issues . this is been going on since the beginning.... just saying guys . thax anyways¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
It doesn’t sync most of the time. Some features not on the iPad. I think it needs an update¨¨x¨x¨¨¨2¨71
Tabs on the side takes up way to much screen space on my iPad. I like the old tabs on top.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨71
I have been using OneNote for years to manage my college courses. Recently, I got a new iPad Pro and naturally the first app I downloaded was OneNote. Much to my surprise the application crashes every 10-15 minutes. After doing some online research, I foun¨¨x¨x¨¨¨2¨71
It is a bit un clear how to use one note best, and what are all the possibilities.  I have it on my Surface and phone. But it is not easy to start a new file or document and then save it to use on your phone.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨71
Infuriatingly impossible to change font on phone so it's always 11 aerial or whatever when on my laptop its 16 Verdana and no matter how many times I follow the instructions to change it iant apparent on the android app which is fully up to date. A pretty ¨x¨¨x¨¨¨2¨71
Great to have notes in one place. If there was a inc to text features on the iPad Pro , this would be 5 stars.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨71
文档复制粘贴出去是图片，好比PS合并图层那么贱¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨71
Could not paste text copied from another app.¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨71
I really want to love this app, but the persistent syncing problems have rendered this app virtually useless, unless all you want to do is view your notes (as opposed to editing them).  One problem is that you&#39;re constantly asked to sign in, because yo¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
I want to use this app, but it has become more frustrating to use everyday. I use OneNote on the Mac and on my iPad so I rely heavily on the syncing. But every day I need to sign into my Microsoft account to continue syncing across all my devices. Having t¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨71
OneNote on iOS STILL lacks the ability to record audio while simultaneously taking written notes. This makes the app useless for me for note taking purposes. Basically only use it to review notes I&#39;ve taken on my laptop.¨x¨¨x¨¨¨2¨71
This app is okay but I feel that it is missing some big features and the audio recording is so-so. I would love to see this app with 1) Dark mode on Android 10+, 2) Pin a sticky to the home screen as a widget, 3) The ability to sort notes¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨71
Microsoft you can do better. First of all I have to say I like the app - it's a decent Evernote replacement, but Microsoft's development team is taking way too long to get this 100 compliant. I want to put it on my homescreen but the icon is just so ugly o¨x¨¨¨x¨¨2¨71
I’ve used it for grocery lists, to-do lists, and logging various things and always relied on it...but now I’m looking for a replacement. Biggest issue for me is when I open up an existing document, instead of the cursor staying at the bottom of the page (n¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨71
The summary: when it works as it&#39;s supposed to, then it&#39;s a 5 star app, it surpasses all other note taking apps, and life is wonderful:  It becomes &#39;my precious&#39; and I know that with its power, I will soon conquer the world.  But over time,¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨71
Multi-platform competitor to Evernote, but lacks background sync, and powerful editing options like Evernote. Background sync is sorely missing.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨71
Hand written text shifts a few pixels. Super annoying. This is a known issue and Microsoft has been aware of it for over a year. They have been promising a fix since late 2018. Detract from an otherwise good product.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
It looks and sounds as if it would be a good app to use, problem is I cant really see for myself. It just won’t allow me to create a new notebook :/ It does let me choose a color but that’s about it. Just glad it was free so I can find something that will ¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨71
I love this program, and it is a good concept, but it needs work. First of all, why no subscripts and superscripts? I need those for taking notes in math and chemistry. I am also having a lot of trouble with accessing documents from my iPhone and iPad. It ¨x¨¨x¨¨¨2¨71
why this apps suddenly force closed everytime i open?? this today, sept 24, did you make some changes?¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
Onenote save me from hours of &#34;What did I do with that note on nautical term. I really need that now!&#34; I use a mac with a Microsoft Word program and I like saving everything on OneDrive. I recently lost 12 chapters...yes 12 on iCloud backup which i¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
Just disappointed,I downloaded this app to help me with school but none of my things for school are there¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨71
This app is great, and I want to love it, but it will NOT stay open while dealing with a webpage. The moment I click away from the OneNote app, it immediately crashes and it makes it nearly impossible for me to take notes properly. Someone PLEASE FIX THIS.¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨71
Okay, so you can call me any word that&#39;s mean. But, i&#39;m preeetty sure some of us hate that one-note.  Is the worst app EVER, the only freakin reason everyones happy about this so called &#34;Trash&#34;. Is cause there low-class, bussiness people w¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨71
Where's the Sticky Notes feature on the tablet version?¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨71
I downloaded this app to only be used with my Apple Pencil. The problem is, my fingers can still draw while I use my Apple Pencil, simultaneously. That&#39;s not helpful, nor is it useful. Seeing black dots drawn/added by my joints is infuriating. Not only¨¨¨x¨x¨¨2¨71
I’m using this app and more or less satisfied, but some features are awful.  While using the app in splitview on iPad, I can’t just continue using Apple pen in one note, because it switches to typing and also shows me the last edited piece of a big doc, so¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨71
Freezes at 50%.  Needs to be redone.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
The helps organize myself, but it&#39;s needs adjustments that better allow me to organize it e.g. sort by creation date, tags, date modified, etc¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨71
"Application freezes after opening with ""Home screen"" shortcut access and with split screen. Dark mode widget is horrible!"¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨71
Buggy, no dark mode and doesn't properly sync between devices. I have a shared notebook and we constantly get sync errors saying we need to open it on a PC to resolve. Very helpful that...¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨71
Some of OneNote features are definitely better than Evernote, but a critical feature to me is tagging and OneNote seems to have missed the point with this feature, where Evernote did it very well. At its most basic, a page I make in OneNote relates to som¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨71
Great idea, but actually it doesn't work as it is supposed to... Typical problems include syncing between devices, uploading pictures, uploaded content ends up in a section you didn't choose, error report although upload worked ... It's a pity¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨71
Battery drainer. Sync is awfully slow. No dark theme. Plain white just hurt the eyes!¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨71
जो भी लिखूं वो ग़लत होता है। मात्रा खुद ग़लत हो जाती है¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨71
Do not use OneNote as an APP Its only good for computer You are unable to undo an error if you delete text, pages etc Say goodbye to the info¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨71
Sometimes it lags . But using on my laptop and phone randomly makes my work easier.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨71
When you use OneNote on an iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard, using the left and right arrow keys causes the cursor to skip two characters at a time.  This can be pretty disruptive to workflow when you need to edit or adjust previously taken notes.¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨71
I am a huge fan of onenote. However, when I switch to iPad, I found lack of Apple Pencil support. For example, in good notes, you can search your handwriting. If onenote add hand writing recognition/to text function, I am even willing to pay for the app. ¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨71
Please make the toolbar/header more compact. Different page backgrounds would be nice, especially dot grid. Also, page jitters from palm contact. Maybe page width lock?¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
Hey, Microsoft, I know it’s a free app, but where is the handwriting to text command button on the iPad app? You have it for a laptop but you can’t hand write on one without touch screen ability.  I like the other features but the lack of that particular f¨x¨¨x¨¨¨3¨71
Good app for syncing for all devices. Some issues are pin pointing between text or letters may not work well especially with images in them. Always seem to select the wrong object when I try to select the text after I inserted an image.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
It would be nice to access notebooks stored in places other than OneDrive and to be able to display specific pages or sections on the Home Screen. However the App is getting better slowly over time.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨71
The new update has taken away the way to use ink color wheel and brightness adjustment!! It’s so hard to switch between various different colors now, even though you can program pens into the bar now.  Also the options for thickness of the pens are terrib¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
All products of Microsoft have problems with sign in. OneNote is not an exception. I can't get access to my work notes from this app.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
The mobile version seems to utilize OneNote 2016 which does not sync with my Desktop App. So much wasted time trying to find notes created in one version or the other. Why can’t OneNote and OneNote 2016 talk to each other? Very inefficient!¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨71
I wish the mobile app had a Tag Finder summary tool similar to the desktop version.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
Why can't I change the font?¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨71
So so¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨71
Very nice but multi window mode not possible on ios yet and difficult to print¨x¨¨x¨¨¨3¨71
While OneNote has made some great improvements the connectivity leaves a bit to be desired. We operate Office 365 and the switching between the online version and the mobile app.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨71
Great app, well organized, but unlike one drive documents - every time i open one note, i have to scroll to the point i left last time,,,there is no auto suggest to pick up from where i left last,,,¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
The reason I didnt give this app a higher rating is because you cannot record audio and take notes at the same time like you can on windows. This is an extremely crucial function that needs to be integrated soon¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
My efforts to reinstall (due to resetting of mobile phone), ONE NOTE app during the last 7 days have failed. I am getting message that 'something has gone wrong. We can' t do what you asked. Error Ox000078B'. I have been using One Note for the last many ye¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨71
Thanks for great app but need to lettile feature like that exists in iPad and more¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨71
crashes every other time i use the app¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨71
The app is good but not that friendly and good as desktop app. Please bring more editing features in this app like text colour, size, etc.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
There is just so much glitching¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨71

"Recently - perhaps since the latest update? - I can no longer share a website directly to a OneNote notebook. The OneNote notification says ""working on it"", but it's never successful. This is one of the features I use regularly, & it's frustrating that it'"¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
The latest version looks nice but constantly wants me to log in/enter the password. Please get that fixed.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
Printing issue—page width did not print properly...it appears to be full page and then when trying to print it is one one column wide. I found it difficult to fix problem.  Could only  print using screenshots.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
I already did this and it wants it again.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨71
Hangs too much.... But it's a very good app expect for frequent hanging¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨71

I don't know why they have not given clipboard past option in one note so difficult to type mobile nos in note by typing manually.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
Keeps freezing up screen so can't put in what you want.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨71
I find difficult to type and creates different font. It don’t allow you  to create a paper level guide. I didn’t like it and erased it.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71

When searching for a specific word in your notebooks/sheets, there is no way of knowing if the search is active or if it is already done searching, plus it doesn't highlight the word in the page once it has found it. When trying to move sheets, there is no¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71

I like one note but lack of zoom write with stylus like in other app¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
The lack of many features available on PC makes me questions the viability of using this app. How do you not include the ability to multi-select notes? When I long press a note it even brings up a screen that looks like any other apps multiselect option wo¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
The app is really good, however, it should include a pen only function for 4-stars and some writing gestures for 5-stars. I dont see how you would rate higher since its a very simple app. If more stuff is implemented into its straight forward UI then I'm s¨x¨¨¨x¨¨3¨71
Very credible note-taking capability with a lot of extras. After installing the new 2019 Windows 10 OneNote on my desktop, OneNote Web Clipper ON MY PHONE quit working. How to fix?¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨71
Too many sync errors¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨71
There are page conflicts but it never really shows me what they are for. Otherwise, I really like that it's synced to most my devices except there's no app for Chromebook.¨¨x¨x¨¨¨3¨71
I love One Note and use it on all my devices, but for some reason, on my iPad, every time I open the app, I am prompted to sign in to synce the notebook. Very frustrating!!!!!¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨71
Good¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨71
I don’t prefer this app, but I use it regardless bc I like my notes in ‘Journals’; it makes storing and reviewing them easier for each class. Disclosure: I have access to Microsoft 365 apps through my university. One bothersome habit is that OneNote syncs ¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨71
Not Perfect. A good idea, but glitches a lot-- especially on a phone. If it were upgraded, and didn&#39;t glitch so much and was more organized, I would absolutely give it a 5-star and love OneNote. It helps with writing with your friends from a long ways ¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨71
I’m writing an article so what I need the most is being able to draw tables in this app so that I can take notes more effectively.I wish it were possible.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
Recording randomly won’t work. While I am midway through studying the page will revert to the beginning.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨71
some time to time is slow working, please try to solve it¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨71

Anyone know why my notes from my app got erased after changing to a new phone??  Had all of it backed up to iCloud and all my other apps are fine.¨¨¨x¨¨¨4¨71
Realmente útil para controlar todas tus notas en cualquier dispositivo, le daba 5* si se sincronizara mejor (muchas veces los cambios no cargan en el móvil, si abro un nuevo bloc en el pc no aparece por defecto en el móvil etc..) y estaría bien poder impor¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨71

Very fine piece of software. Combined with office lens it is awesome.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨71
This app is great!! There is one HUGE flaw that I have discovered though. When you make a note in a list formate, you cannot check off completed things on the Apple Watch nor if it is checked off in the app will it appear as checked off on the Apple Watch,¨x¨¨x¨¨¨4¨71
Best app for note taking, by far. I’ve used evernote (too many syncing conflicts, unintuitive list sorting), default notes app on iPhone, and this is by far the best. I love the formatting options, text boxes that can be arranged visually, sections and col¨¨x¨¨x¨¨4¨71
OneNote has allowed me to set up informational as well as project files for my crafts. The ability to incorporate photos and add explanatory text as the project proceeds to completion makes the app really useful.  I would give it 5 stars if I could move im¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨71

Had I learned to use this a few years ago, I would have saved myself lots of time.Because it works across my laptop and tablet, I can put in an item I will need on the other device, and when I do get to the other device it's waiting for me.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨71

Great note app. Love the cloud. Can't print from app though.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨71

Does what i need it to do.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨71
Big fan of OneNote but need handwriting to be searchable when only using the iPad app.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨71
Good app when I remember t use it. Had sync problems when I set up new phone and it wouldn&#39;t sync my notebooks but got it figured out.¨¨x¨x¨¨¨4¨71
Great app. When making a list or bullet point list in the iPhone app, there is no visible cursor. This makes it hard to easily see where you start to type. Also would like to see the ability to do handwriting with a stylus. This feature is available in man¨¨¨x¨¨¨4¨71
Love this, but there is (for some unfathomable reason?!) no way to change the titles of your notebooks in mobile app version??¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨71
This app is a foundation of my life as a student. The sync between devices is great for continuity in work flow. The sync issue appears to be fixed so the app is perfect.¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨71

Difficult for new users to navigate between different channels, DMs, see new members, invite members to specific channels, etc. Why is the invite ability for a channel only for external users?¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨48
Please, do some REAL usability analysis.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨48
Used to be okay but this new ui change makes it difficult to use.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨48
Very hard and confusing to navigate on the app.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨48
Don't have any option to add smiles and also takes a while to set the status away / online.¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨48
Just that. Not a great app, really. Good idea, but overrated¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨48
Notification are not working for android¨¨¨x¨¨¨2¨48
Can&#39;t see how this tool differentiates itself from an ordinary bulletin board service that has been around forever.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨48
What’s the point of having a communication app if multiple emails can’t be utilized in one place or if it’s so difficult to change from one organization to the next on the mobile device¨x¨¨¨x¨¨2¨48
The features are all good. But most of the time, didn't show ANY NOTIFICATION of new mentions or messages. Like, I HAVE TO open the app for 24/7 in case someone tag me to an urgent matter. Already ENABLE ALL NOTIFICATION settings, all priority, all in full¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨48
I can't always read my DMs. I'll get the preview of the first few words, but when I try to read the rest, I can't access them at all. These are the most important messages I have, and I have to open my laptop to read them. That's definitely a pain: why eve¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨48
I&#39;ve been to the settings multiple times to determine what kind of notifications I receive (I selected only direct messages) but I continue to get notifications when anybody posts to a topic. It&#39;s driving me crazy!!¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨48
Navigation is now a real pain if you're in multiple slack accounts. 😟¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨48
IMHO, Slack is not user friendly.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨48
Lackluster, over rated, and unjustifiably expensive.¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨48
Still slower than Hipchat. Messages take a king time to sync in a fast WiFi connection with low latency. Switching between teams is too many steps. Still prefer irssi in a mosh tmux session.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨48
Needs a dark mode¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨48

Pretty meh.¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨48
I have been using this app for about a year. I love it&#39;s functionality but with every release it seems to get slower and slower. The lag is almost unbearable at this point.¨x¨x¨¨¨¨2¨48
well i tried downloading It and it went to 100 percent but its not installing¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨48
Good App but fails miserably in delivering notifications. delayed notifications and repeated notifications of read messages is disturbing a lot.¨x¨x¨¨¨¨2¨48
Great functionality and useful tool, but the app crashes constantly on my iPhone 6 with most recent iOS. I have to delete and reinstall multiple times per day. Basically unusable in current state.¨¨x¨x¨¨¨2¨48
"The app is stuck in an endless ""connecting..."" loop. Channels load but can't do anything since it's constantly trying to ""connect"". Tried re-installing multiple times but no luck. Still the same result. I'm wondering whether the latest update caused this? "¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨48
Please add update to delete multiple messages at once instead of one at a time!!!!!********** Will edit rating¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨48
Doesn't send real time notifications. There! Some had the say it.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨48
Suddenly unusable, just hangs. Cache clearing didn't help.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨48
Took too long to download¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨48
Useful app if I could hear notifications. Why are the sounds so quiet? And why can't I select a notification sound of my own instead of being restricted to theirs? No difficulty with notifications on any other app but Slack. Trialling it for my team but se¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨48
I get the notification by the app itself doesn't update at the same speed¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨48
"Bugs: 1. On Dark Theme text sometimes is shown in black color, making it invisible. 2. ""Snooze until next week"" disregards device regional settings (e.g. in Israel the work week starts on Sunday rather than Monday, but Snooze until next week shows Monday)."¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨48
I never get notifications, I have done troubleshooting also. I only get a notification while troubleshooting. I have tried reinstalling also. Please help me out..¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨48
The android version is far from ideal. It loads the messages after considerable lag.  Hope you fix it.¨¨x¨x¨¨¨2¨48
I love Slack. Use it all day, every day to talk to coworkers, friends, etc. That being said, the iPhone app is a mess. I&#39;ve yet to come across glitchier software. Every update is worse than the last. Find some better developers, guys. You&#39;re better¨¨¨x¨x¨¨2¨48
App itself runs fine etc., but it has really hurts my focus at work to use slack and when I'm out of work I still feel like I need to check it.  It's way too much on top of email, maybe if my workplace only used Slack but that's not the case.  Plus I just ¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨48
When clicking on a selected photo for uploading to use in one’s profile, the app just suddenly quits, and no photo is added.  🙄🤔¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨48
Where's the actionable notifications on Android Wear? New design looks great.¨¨¨x¨x¨¨2¨48
Whenever the app is loading anything (text, reactions, attachments) it causes the app to lock up for small fractions of a second, even if I&#39;m in the middle of typing something. That results in missed key strokes and I have to retype things. The app als¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨48

Constant stream of irrelevant notifications that I didn&#39;t sign up for. Feels like my work phone with the constant buzz coming from said notifications. Once I turned them off it was fine but the app itself isn&#39;t very intuitive.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨48
Never received any notification for new message when app runs in background. I have done all correct notification settings and whenever I open the app it shows some kind of top bar with offline message and then connecting.. Seriously?! I am on a 4G network¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨48
App is amazing for the most part, except for a recurring bug. In high volume channels, messages get missed and never load in the app. Slack support has directed me to reset the cache, which works great, it&#39;s just annoying that I have had to do it 3 tim¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
The app works well and overall the solution is great, but you have to fix those frequent outages, this doesn’t give a good impression. It’s the third time in two weeks that I have problems with the app, trying to get stuff done and I can’t because your ser¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨48
Good enough but improve side scroll like you do in desktop version¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
Great app, great concept. But as others have stated, notifications not  working properly are causing major issues in my business. Hope you can get  this sorted (android)¨x¨¨x¨¨¨3¨48
Slack is a very good communication tool. However this app has a some flaws. Main of them is the sync not working properly every time.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨48
Hello team, I am trying to join an existing team but the app only allows me to create a team. Please tell me how to do it¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨48
Everything​ is good but the problem I am facing on notifications. I am not getting notifications on my phone. If someone message me I didn't get any notification.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
I'd rather recommend GroupMe, but this is a bit more project-based. I expected just a bit more than a Business Discord¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨48
Good app, very useful. However the app does not do well with notifications. I have my notifications setting turned on to where I should receive every message I get in slack. However I still don’t receive all of my notifications. I only get DMs notified to ¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
Doesn't update threads. Sends notifications but you cannot access the new content.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
I love this app, but the notifications are always getting jacked up! I snooze a conversation or mute a channel and the notifications will mess up afterwards.  Is there a way to mute all teams &amp; channels for a period of time?   Also, how do I get them¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨48
Only fault in recent updates is false indicators that new activity in channels. Anytime I list the teams I always see the dot next to the team name, which should indicate new activity but there isn't any.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
Some bugs with channels and notifications¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
Unfortunately,  its a bit cost prohibitive to get some of the more worthwhile features such as longer message archiving¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
Don't receive notification anymore on my phone.¨x¨¨x¨¨¨3¨48
I miss the older layout, or at least parts of it, like being able to easily see a list of the rooms and people. Also why take away the fun color of the app icon? Why purple? Seems a little slower now, too, but I can't say for sure.¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨48
First off, thank you slack for a great app. The note taking section to yourself is fantastic as well, among other features. The only reason for the stars is that I have one big issue with the app that I want to see improved. If there&#39;s anything that n¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
just following the hype¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨48
As usual, great concept. I love that you guys monetized IRC into something the common man can use, but the delay time of when a message is displayed / offset by when the actual app is opened ruins the true &#34;instant&#34; message experience that the app ¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨48
Please optimize the battery consumption, this app simply destroys battery. For some reason, it keeps running in the background, even with background sync off.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨48
You can talk to people, custom emojis, required by work so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨48
Enough said for now.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨48
I really like this app but for some reason I can't turn on the schedule button for Do Not Disturb. Anytime I try to and the slider turns blue, it immediately turns off again. This is the only problem I've had so far.¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨48
Awesome app, but from my past few months facing an issue that notifications don't come up, checked settings multiple times, things look fine there¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
Hey i love the app, but i am using a xiaomi redmi note 3, and i have done everything i have read to enable the notifications, but your app doesnt seem to have the permissions to open popout notifications. Can you take a look at it please?¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
Hey guys, I love slack but the new version feels more cumbersome to use, everything takes so much more time. For example, sending DM's now takes so much longer.¨¨x¨¨x¨¨3¨48
Love the idea but having trouble with the adoption. I'm a heavy android mobile based user and a frustrating factor for me is that I'm unable to receive any form of notification from any channels. Went through the suggested steps in the Help Center but ther¨x¨¨x¨¨¨3¨48
I would give this 4 or 5 stars, however, I think it would greatly improve the chat if it showed who has read each of the messages, like Facebook​ messenger does, that way people are kept accountable when they realize that others can tell if they read a mes¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
Needs the ability to set out of office¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
Have to use it for work. It is okay.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨48
This app is not user friendly I think¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨48
Use slack daily but saddened by the tablet version of this app. IPad version is very good but android one is sub par.¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨48
Can't push notification properly even though notification is on for the app. Sometimes message won't go. Sometimes conversation feed won't update even if I connect & disconnect data again! Not just my case. Same happened to 3 of my business partners as wel¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
After a month of  acceptable performance, the app crashed on attempt to wake up from background. The app doesn't start again (hung in connecting phase) Perhaps, the recent server-side issue hasn't been resolved despite the status?¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨48
Login shows no error and I’m clueless about what’s happening¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
Love slack, I do have some issues with the app.  Mobile app has a tendency to not send messages or miss notifications.  Presuming mostly because of flakey connections but I do not have these issues with other message platforms such as whatsapp or hangouts¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨48
"When a newessage comes on while I'm typing, the keyboard is automatically closes and the next ""keystroke"" ends up opening a message in the history. This happens daily, it's very irritating"¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
You can&#39;t set reminders on slack for iOS. I am hoping that slack can do a feature match with its application on other devices (read windows).¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨48
Please make this app work on the Apple Watch.¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨48
This app drains my phone's battery rather quickly.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨48
Constantly drops connection, despite internet working. Not happy with missing important work messages. Generally a great product, just not on my Android.¨¨x¨x¨¨¨3¨48
Имеется классная возможность создать thread, что выгодно отличает от других мессенджеров. На этом всё.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨48
Works relatively well for what I need it for. It doesn&#39;t work well for me when I try to share a link from safari. Clicking to change channel just closes the share dialog. I tend to share a bit and need this to work.¨¨¨x¨¨¨3¨48
I'm not sure since when, but currently notifications either come in very late (1 hr after the message) and even if I've already read the message or not at all.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨48
Channel notifications and coming to phone on alerts. But then opening the it’s not clear which channel as the unread count does not light¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨48
The last few weeks, all the notifications I get from slack are doubled. Each message is repeated twice and the message count is 2x what it should be.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
"It's a great concept, like IRC made easy. Very good for internal chats for companies and teams, and even between friends and social organizations. However, unfortunately, it is NOT ""well-designed"" as others have said. With every release over the past year "¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨48
The app features are great, but it is really slow. Is it possible to get a Lite version from Slack too, so it would support older phones?¨x¨x¨x¨¨¨3¨48
Guys, your new update cannot connect to team url it looks like the whole signin process doesnt work¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨48
The app is slow, even on a top device. It often doesn&#39;t receive notifications when it is off and doesn&#39;t update notifications counter despite the background refresh setting is on. The app is made on HTML apparently, that&#39;s why it has such probl¨x¨x¨¨¨¨3¨48
But it&#39;s a missing a to do list. I use this app regularity to communicate with my project team and the only thing missing is built in to do app.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨48
Pretty good aside from a never-ending draft that won't go away and if I click it, it just brings me to the channel but doesn't show me the draft. Can't delete it either. Left and rejoined channel and it came back. Must be a glitch.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨48
Great comms¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨48
Good app!¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨48
Wow dis app be da stuff it da Wei¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨48
"The inability to ""heart""  a message or comment means that I have to use 2 different group apps to communicate with my fellow teammates in the ARG Ingress. If Slack added that functionality, it would be more compelling to switch the GroupMe users to Slack. "¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨48
This app is great for communication between players in games. You can speak individually or as a team. Use it all the time¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨48
The integration of other clouds is essential, it does not list OneDrive or Evernote, and I am hoping it is supported and its just  not listed, but if it's not is would be the icing on the cake and I'll give 5 🌟s! Also the in line images & video video with¨¨¨x¨¨¨4¨48

Great team/project tools¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨48
I love slack but the app isn't syncing as well as it used to. Much more frequently it updates the side bar with new message indicators but can't show the messages, or shows old ones. Same issue on desktop.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨48
Great¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨48
As a blind voiceover user, I am figuring out how to use Slack efficiently. It’s challenging at times, but becoming easier.¨¨¨¨x¨¨4¨48
Web layout is buggy sometimes, but the app is really great!¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨48
Love the do not disturb hours and work life balance philosophy.  Does a pretty good job tracking what was read on multi devices.  So much much better than Jabber.  Wish multi team could see number of in read in all teams by channel in one screen.¨x¨¨x¨¨¨4¨48
it needs a dark theme ASAP. Also I would like to have loading messages like the Web app.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨48
I love the app, but there's no way to enable push notifications, they're simply not working. I've tried everything¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨48
Animations could be improved. Also, I find the nav drawer counterintuitive. I would have never thought it was clickable if it wasn't for the fact I was looking for the channels. Maybe including some initial modal to teach how to use the app?¨¨¨¨x¨¨4¨48
love the desktop, the mobile client often has syncing issues¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨48
Love this app for my Minecraft Servers Staff Team Coms, but it seems to slow down / overheat my phone randomly? Not sure if it is doing a constant loop to see if it is connected to a network or not, (usually offline). Other than that it works great for PC,¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨48

I've been using slack since way back in early Beta. It has come quite a long way and it is welcome to see the Slack app updated for Google Material Design Standards. I feel like the app performs slower now since the change. Hopefully that can be ironed out¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨48

We use this as a tool for our editors to communicate, as well as a member perk for an online publication.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨48

No complaints¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨48

It's very slow to boot on old devices. It's just very slow for too many things. Resource hog. The same problem with all recent apps. Developers get lazy and don't care about older devices.¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨48

The app is outstanding and has brought my team closer together. There are some frustrating bugs/lag but it’s pretty rare. The integration should undergo some QA before Slack lists them.¨x¨x¨¨¨¨4¨48

I like how it has all the same features and keeps settings/notifications/status in sync with the desktop. My only complaint is how sluggish the app can be for large (over 1000 channels and users) Slack instances. I wish it were faster to load and more resp¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨48
Great app. Would be even better if there were an option for read receipts.  Would come back and give a 5 stars if/when that happens.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨48

This app is great for the most part. Has tons of useful features and is very stable, with a great UI and fluid performance. Only issues with it are that viewing images takes two taps instead of automatically going full screen and not being able to see how ¨x¨x¨¨x¨¨4¨48
It’s ok thus far. Sort of clunky¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨48

Excellent iPhone app, makes Slack a breeze on the go on both iPad and iPhone. Simple to use. Has really helped with being effective away from desk, out and about. One of the best i-apps I&#39;ve seen. I highly recommend it if you use Slack!¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨48
I have been using Slack and I find it to be efficient and intuitive. It makes team communication very simple although the one thing I am missing is video chatting. Overall, this app is very well-rounded. Magic link: I have never seen something like magic ¨x¨¨¨¨¨5¨48

Email now is 100% external communication... while all internal communication is done on slack. Inbox has dropped from 180+ emails a day to less than 20 🚀¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨48

Slack for iPhone works very reliably and smoothly. I&#39;m in many organizations with many messages being sent, and I never notice issues. Slack is a great service.¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨48

I experienced a 400% upcharge on a ride I took a few days ago with no notice. I noticed it in my bank account first. Not only does Uber not have a number to call to speak to an actual person, when I used their support messaging system, they insisted that m¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨15
I have an issue with my family account on Uber. Throws an error whenever someone tries to use it. Payment is valid. I’ve contacted Uber repeatedly over weeks to get help and they continue to drop the ball or don’t even respond!!Use Lyft whenever possible¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨15
Racist, xenophobic opportunist.¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨15
New app icon and branding are beyond awful. Hate it, and can never find it on my screen. Whomever was involved with this rebrand should try a new line of work.¨¨¨¨x¨¨1¨15

The app never works and it claims my mobile number can't be confirmed for some reason that I don't understand.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨15
This has happened twice where I&#39;ve been charged an amount for my ride and all of the sudden there has been additional money taken out of my account. When I inquire about it, they say it&#39;s a &#34;preauthorization hold&#34; and it keeps my money for ¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨15
Where’s the number to call ? So many issues with drivers and I can’t get a full refund.¨¨¨¨x¨¨1¨15

Uber is draining my battery like crazy since I updated. They force you to always share your location.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨15
Will take them some time to iron out the kinks. They broke what didn&#39;t require a fix! But that&#39;s true for anything that&#39;s undergone such a big revamp.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨15

The app requires you to either have location awareness on all the time or not at all. When you choose to not have it on the app operates inefficient. Now I either have to turn location awareness on and off when I need to uber or use a competitor that doesn¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨15
Uber call feature is quite terrible...even after disconnecting the call.. continuously app call appeared on screen which make u unable to access uber app for driver or cab details... data call is too pathatic that me and driver was not able to talk and cal¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨15
This app wants to know my local location even when I&#39;m not using the app. This is an unwarranted invasion of my privacy.¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨15

Very bad app. very poor driver service, not happy with driver service( car number : WB25G9852) when I when I book my trip and call the driver for contact the the driver does not received my call, it's not fast time our, almost this has happened to me 5 to ¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨15
"Not user friendly. What about ""Rate the trip"" option? It is not working properly. It is bad jesture from UBER."¨x¨¨¨¨¨1¨15
Uber has no need to require location services be on at all times in the latest update. Totally offensive. Cut it out or lose my businesss.¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨15
They only care about themselves and could care less about their users.¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨15
Bekaar Uber I leave this app👎👎👎👎👎👎👎¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨15
Uber has this time frame crap that is very inconvenient to all, why would I look for a ride just for the app to force me to wait 5 extra mins.. then we have racist drivers who will cancel the ride and have us waiting even longer. Lyft would’ve been much qu¨¨x¨¨¨¨1¨15
Uber was good in the beginning now it is trash. If you love rude drivers, unnecessary fees, and being late I don&#39;t suggest this app. Drivers will deliberately arrive and not tell you their location or arrive in different cars and not tell you and cance¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨15
I had to delete the app when i realized that i was spending way too much in one night. I used too pay 15 dollars to go  too one place and come back home  all together . Last night i realized  everything came up to 30$ to go and come back. Why am i paying a¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨15
The average person does not understand that the No Cars Available button, is something that you should push to get queued up for the next available Uber. This means that those users will simply give up, and flag down a taxi. That&#39;s bad for both riders ¨¨¨¨x¨¨1¨15
I can&#39;t link my PayPal account. When you Google &#34;Uber PayPal errors&#34; see what the search engine brings up. I wouldn&#39;t be so upset if this was a recent issue, but this has been a problem since the year 2015. Smh. I have to use Lyft now.¨¨¨x¨¨¨1¨15
Horrible customer service. The driver cancels and I am charged. No way to complain.¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨15

After I&#39;ve updated it, I was so thrilled to see it&#39;s new interface and functions. But when I opened the app, it said it&#39;s unavailable in my area. That&#39;s so disappointing.¨¨¨¨¨x¨1¨15

Stop letting me think my driver will be here within a certain time period if it&#39;s just gonna keep changing. I try to get the uber with enough time to make it to work but lately I haven&#39;t been wanting to use the app because I never know what to expe¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
Hides functionality (fare split, for example), adds a superfluous &#39;news feed&#39; style thing to upsell you, and makes everything generally harder to use.  On the plus side, it still technically works.¨x¨¨¨x¨¨2¨15
Uber is very useful and I&#39;ve used it many times BUT the image of the driver and the car is sooooo TINY that it&#39;s hard to identify them when they are picking you up in a busy place. I don&#39;t know why they don&#39;t make the images bigger!¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨15
This app is kind of garbage now days. Its not giving a live update on rides and gives the wrong directions or long way to destinations which costs more money or loss in getting a ride in the first place.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨15
If you can tolerate the inconsistency and rudeness Uber drivers provide, ride on!¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
I don't see the option to add UPI transaction¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
Used Uber a lot. With new update it looks fancy but got a little confusing with its new features. There are too many drivers accepting, not showing up, and then canceling putting the reason that I didn&#39;t want to take the ride. Wasted my time finding an¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨15

Drivers should not be able to pick up a ride when they are already in service to other riders. I had a driver who accepted my Uber and the passenger he had; that he was completing a ride for, added a stop. That put me out 20 more minutes for my ride. What ¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨15
The way you charge fare is so unfair its sad . i want a direct price on my trip not an estimate on how much it *may* cost .I to travel within in my means but youre using cheap tricks to pocket more money . no thank you whats the point . i was almost diamon¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
the past two or three times uber updates the GPS gets all screwed up and it tells drivers to pick up and drop off in the totally wrong places -- multiple blocks off. this has happened numerous times to myself and friends on various versions of this app, an¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨15
Cada vez se inventan rutas más largas para cobrar más de lo debido¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
Since Uber released this new version, I have had more erroneous pick up addresses than ever before. Their determination to have GPS decide where to pick up riders seems ignorant of the many, many tall buildings in Manhattan and the frequently rushed proces¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨15
Kind of frustrating that not all phones can request rides. I keep the app up to date but yet I still don’t have the option to request rides. I have school very early in the morning and sometimes there isn’t an Uber driver out when I need to get to school. ¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
I had used uber for almost 5 years until recently.My buddy and I took a ride on a Saturday night. My friend left his glasses (prescription) and I left a hat behind. The following morning, I contacted uber which put me in touch with the driver. The drive¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
I booked a ride home from the San Diego airport and the app said the driver was 18 minutes away. I noticed the arrival time got stuck on 12 minutes. I waited 15 minutes more. I called and texted the driver but no response. I was forced to cancel and rebook¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
What icon is this? What a terrible rebrand -- good thing I noticed the app updating or I would have had a difficult time actually locating my Uber icon. A big U, as once represented the brand, is a clean, simple, and ubiquitously recognized way to market t¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨15
Estimated time of arrival has gone worse!!¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨15
Seriously terrible app at this point. The map is always wrong and screws up pickups constantly. Also tells me the driver is arriving about five minutes before they arrive. For a single girl who works overnight, this is unacceptable as it makes pickups unsa¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨15
I can’t tell you how many times I get charged for a ride that never shows up - happens way to often so I switched to Lyft.¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
I am from Singapore. I am currently at the age where I have to Serve NS (National Service) I have to reach my NS area by 7:55am but everytime I have to wait 15mins just for the Uber driver to arrive even though I book at 7:15am my driver only arrive at 7:3¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨15

Every time I use Uber I have a problem. I have to wait so long, and when the ride is finally here, it switches to another person or suddenly the time frame extends so I am waiting a very long time. In winter this is horrible.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨15
Car air conditioning was not working at all¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
Not clear what surge charge is and how it changes¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
Prior to this update, the app was great. Now it defaults to Pool when I don&#39;t want it and I have to additional scroll to locate all possible Uber options. Also, Uber wanting to track my location at all times is not acceptable. While I am using it, ok. ¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨15
I updated this app now it won&#39;t let me see a price estimate. Very disappointed.¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨15
Eh, someone submit the wrong app to the App Store? Besides that app icon being an April fools joke, the drivers not knowing where they&#39;re going, fake screen saver of cars being near you when they aren&#39;t really close and no visibility into what ou¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨15
Because the drivers often forget and some even actually do it on purpose. Letting the passengers have their own &#34;I have safely arrived&#34; or whatever button on their app would help a lot¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨15
I love the app. I love uber.I hate not being able to tip with in the app. Like seriously. As someone who NEVER carries cash, I have to tell my uber to stop somewhere for me to withdraw cash in order to tip, and I don&#39;t like it. LET ME TIP WITHIN THE ¨x¨¨¨¨¨2¨15
Too expensive :(¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
Not only are the directions horrible, but the estimated time when the driver will arrive is always off!!! I really love the idea of Uber, but it has a very long way to go in terms of basics like driving directions &amp; time of arrival.¨¨x¨¨¨¨2¨15
billed for waiting fee. Uber said I should be notified. Never was until I got the bill. What’s with This Driver was at wrong door then called me then came to right door then charge me waiting fee of 12 cents¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15
I’ve been trying and trying to use Uber and Uber Eats but it’s just says payment method- credit or debit or PayPal even though I went to the store and got the Uber app and put 30 dollars and I can’t even use them so don’t waste your money¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨15

Seriously? What the f is the new logo suppose to be? Has to be the most incongruous change of identity I&#39;ve ever seen. Besides that uber is pretty great, outside of the occasional weirdo driver.¨¨¨¨x¨¨2¨15
Annoyed that you can no longer shift location to see how many cars are out in different neighborhoods. Took a Lyft instead.¨¨¨¨¨x¨2¨15

This was my first time using Uber, was not to impressed. Driver was late picking up. Car was smaller then expected for a comfort size.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
Was in Miami last month and all the drivers were driving with the phone in there hand... One in particular didn&#39;t say anything to us and blared his music super loud not even offering an aux... Last I checked this is supposed to be about a better ride t¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15

I have an early morning flight and wanted to schedule a ride, but no can do.  Where did this option go?¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
I just got a ride. Uber gave the driver wrong place. The driver went around looking for me     Now I have a to pay for a waiting time. That’s not right. Even it’s not much but I just want the right thing. The driver said that Uber gave him the wrong addres¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15
The app doesn’t allow the rider to cancel a trip when the driver is significantly later than the time it says they will arrive. This has happened more than once with the car arriving 20 minutes later than the 5 minute arrival. There should be an option for¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15
I payed more than the initial fare, thinking it's because of a change in venue, but the same area though.... Later my receipt showed the extra cost being 'waiting time' charge; meanwhile I got there just when the driver arrived! The map display should be i¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
Great app but the interface is not user-friendly sometimes there are issues while operating hope you work on it than i wouldn't mind getting giving 5 stars¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨15
Did you change the app? Now you don’t say the color of the Uber car. Also, Drivers always seem to arrive across the street from my condo. I live at 401 California Ave, Santa Monica,Ca and drivers park in front of 420 California, Wrong side of of street. So¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15
The most recent versions have lost some points for me. They have tried to make this &#34;business user friendly&#34;, and have completely failed. You can now load in multiple cards, and at the same time you can have a personal and business persona. But you¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨15
I simply can’t understand how such a big company doesn’t have fraud detection on their app, and how would I still be able to use the app after my account get compromised. Or at least pop out some message or tell me some trip just finished, the app is just ¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15
For existing accounts where a user lost access to email which can happen hen internet acounts get black listed ouber needs to accept the phone number of the cell phone that&#39;s calling in the email field and then send a verification text and have that us¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15
Turn this back into a app that uses my locations services &#34;while using the app&#34;.  This drains the life out of my battery and I was almost left stranded because of it.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨15

I like uber but they need to simplify their app for easier use for people that aren’t real tech savy.¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨15
I think Uber is wonderful! I especially love the addition of Uber pool. However, I think Uber could take this even one step further by adding a personalization element. Essentially, uber could have a &#34;friends&#34; section which enables users to see whi¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15
If you really want to be a useful service, lower your surcharges on big drinking nights in the country. You could save a lot of lives by not forcing people to choose between driving themselves or paying ridiculous fees.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
When I ride Uber I expect to be first class in every way!  My last ride was not what I expected it to be, the car was very dirty, the truck was full of junk, I  did not want to get on this car. Not a good experience!¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
Uber is one of the hottest up and coming businesses (making more money than any of the competition) and is somehow justifying multiplying the rate by 4x when the area is busy. Hmmmmmm…¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
I was out waiting for  the ride but she was at a different place and had to go around. So it was who had to wait therefore extra charge should not be applied rather the actual charge which was $8.90  should be approved and not over 12 dollars.  I am not pl¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15

I love this service but since I don&#39;t carry cash I really want to tip my driver through the app.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15
Honestly I don’t know what you guys are doing the past few months. The service has went down hill and I’m spending more money now on Uber. I feel like I’m wasting my money, seems like now the app is catered to the drivers. Almost 75% of the cars that show ¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
Mostly good service but airports are a nightmare. I travel to DCA regularly and I for some reason when I summon an uber they seem to sit for several minutes before you see them moving on the map. I&#39;ve even started texting them that I&#39;m already at¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
This app and lyft is almost identical.. There&#39;s updates nearly every other day with no information on what was updated, just a vague statement on how it&#39;s better than the last version.. More unstable than ever¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨15
Uber is just ok in some cities and real good in others.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15

I like uber, and use it quite often. However, I&#39;ve been having trouble with the app since their last update. In fact, it won&#39;t completely load the update on my phone. I tried deleting the app and reinstalling, but that didn&#39;t work. It&#39;s jus¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨15

First Uber hanged the logo to this horrible circle/dot motif. Whomever did that should be fired. Next, they updated the UI/UX of the app. It&#39;s not as &#39;fluid&#39; as it once was. Sure, it works fine, but the usability is less than in previous versio¨¨¨¨x¨¨3¨15
In the U.S. I have not had any problems. However, during my time in Peru, I experience three times drivers saying they picked me up when they did not. It is unfortunate that there is no way to report it to Uber until the driver cancels or &#34;finishes&#34¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15
App functions good - however - you should give us the option to have u track our location only when using app.¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15
Driver notified me he would be 20 min late.   Need a way for them or me to get another driver quickly (especially at the airport).  Uber lost a fair to local cab company...from airport cabs still are the better option.¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
Wonderful¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
Uber no longer has the option for me to schedule a ride in advance which is a problem. It let me schedule a ride in advance not too long ago as well. It will only let me request a ride for the current time only. I would like the problem to be fixed. Thank ¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15
I really like the app.  But there is no option to choose from toll roads or not.  You are charged more for using tolls and my driver never gives me the option to not use tolls.  They just use the tolls automatically because it charges more and they are rec¨x¨¨¨¨¨3¨15
Since this week, after I arrived the first destination then wanted to make another new order for next destination, app was not working, screen shows only my previous order. App start working again only after 5,6 hours later. Please let me know what to do? ¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨15
It&#39;s like an upgraded taxi experience but their matching with Uberpool is really bad. I only use Uber when Lyft isn&#39;t working, which is so rare. Uber just feels so impersonal and lacks personality for me. Feels like a hired ride to the airport.¨¨x¨¨¨¨3¨15
I used to love Uber. I hated taxi rides because you had no idea the cost. Uber changed the industry by telling you the amount of the ride beforehand.  Their new policy says they won’t be telling us the amount of the ride when we request service. I’m moving¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
Often there are a dozen or more shops spread over several hundred yards. They share the same street address but each has a separate suite number. This app cannot find the particular shop you I am looking for. I call a cab, give them the suite  number witho¨¨¨¨¨x¨3¨15
Love Uber! Has saved me a lot of money. Drivers are very nice and friendly. Would like to know the color of the car picking me up and the driver should get to see a pic of the person they&#39;re picking up.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨15
I agree with others. The driver was very good! However, we had to switch to WAZE to get there in a timely manner.¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨15
I know uber were testing suggested pick up location (like Lyft hot spots) not sure what happened. I would love to see this function especially for uber pool. It would be great to have the option for a flexible pick up or drop off - e.g. Ability to Specify ¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨15
I love uber and it works wonderful for me. I&#39;m rather sad to see how they decided to give up their letter U. I believe it was a bad move that will meter be regretted. Regardless, uber is giving regular taxi&#39;s a wake up call to improve.¨¨¨¨x¨¨4¨15

Uber rocks, I always have an outstanding experience when I hitch a ride with them. But Uber really just poo&#39;d the bed with its new logo. Whoever Uber hired to redesign their logo has no idea what brand equity means. Just turn the center part of the ¨¨¨¨x¨¨4¨15
Used Uber one time. It was a fine ride. Will you keep updating the app now that I&#39;ve given you a review?¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
The navigation is not so great¨¨¨¨x¨¨4¨15
Good app,¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
Wish the drivers would make more.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
GPS for pick up location is quite poor (overseas) since the updated version. Bring back the option. Otherwise great!¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨15
1. 15 sec to decide if you want the run isn&#39;t enough, since you have no clue where they&#39;re going.  My first run was what I thought was short to get my feet wet, but when I picked up the passengers, they were going 3 hours away. That&#39;s 6 hours o¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
Very convenient App to use¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
Drivers are nice, except one who begs me to give him a five-star review. Cars sometimes freeze on the map and the time estimated is not accurate.¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨15
The drivers are what makes uber good, if they aren&#39;t making tips they are getting paid less than minimum wage. Add the option to tip!¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨15
I love this app. I use it all the time especially when I didn&#39;t have a car and I needed a ride home from work. What I don&#39;t like is that now the gps is choosing the longest way home and I don&#39;t like that charging me more for a 15 min ride and m¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨15
Great application, but location search requires more training¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨15
Driver was good. But there is a charge for tolls. We didn’t take toll road. Toll charges must be refunded.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨15
Use promo code bennyb79ue for a free ride.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
The app is great overall. However, security can be a big issue. My account was hacked once, and I was not happy. Although, I did receive a refund after sorting everything out with uber.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨15
The last 3 times I’ve Ben picked up at the casino I’ve Ben charged waiting time while I’ve Ben standing for 15 minutes under the Uber lift pick up sign it’s not my fault drivers can’t read or speak English¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
This app is the best but the only thing is that the cars on my map does not move correctly, so do something about it¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨15
I searched all over the app, HELP, Uber.com and the blogs, API developer site—seemingly everywhere.  How does one make suggestions for the app???  No feedback option, no HELP option.  Not even close.  Nothing is available about the app.  I would like to ha¨¨¨¨x¨¨4¨15
I&#39;m trying to sign up and it won&#39;t let me select cash or any other payment method to go thru, so I can&#39;t even sign up. Any help?!¨¨¨¨x¨¨4¨15
My pick up point is Red Savoy Pizza on E Travelers Trail. Uber stops my drivers on E Travelers Trail where I can’t even see them. Now I get charged an extra 2 dollars for waiting on my driver who is not giving the correct directions? Not cool. Purchased th¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
Good¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
Great service and love it but Why is there no way to add a tip to the driver no one carries cash and that way we can expense the entire ride this is long overdue (LYFT) has had that feature from the beginning!¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨15
Super bad experience. I urgently needed an Uber. I ordered it for this app and it took too long to find driver. I canceled it to use another app and that's why I was charged. Keep the money, apparently that matters to them more than losing confidence in cu¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
its like having your own chauffeur very convenient and easy to use!¨¨¨¨x¨¨4¨15
Wonderful.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
The new method to choose the pickup address is not very reliable. There is room for improvement in this, but overall it is an excellent service.¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨15
Works great, would like to see a box so you can request time you would like to be picked up.¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨15
I&#39;m not sure why Uber has so many negative reviews; I personally have had nothing but positive experiences with Uber in my area. The app is easy to navigate through. It&#39;s half the price of Lyft(in my personal opinion), and every driver I&#39;ve had¨¨¨¨x¨¨4¨15
When I get a rate eith Uber that is what u expect to pay. I went from center city to the airport with no tolls roads. Straight 15 minute on I95. Both times at an off hour the fare was $6 more that shown with surcharges. This is mind boggling??¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨15
Hamit is a very safe driver and was especially helpful to my husband who has mobility issues.  He is a very kind man.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
You should give an option to put 2 different destinations for all options except uberpool. Also give drivers the option to cancel the trip in 5 or 10 minutes after they accept a trip because it&#39;s not normal that they call us to cancel the trip and we s¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
I enjoy using Uber but there are times when Uber doesn’t live up to expectations. So there is need for continual improvements. A customer should not have to be charged a fee for canceling a ride. The Taxis’ not doing that to their customers. You shouldn’t ¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
Too many updates¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
When I learned about uber, I didn&#39;t hesitate to sell my car to avoid extra cost of maintenance and insurance. With Uber I can get to my destination fast especially those that needs to take a lot of bus ride. Had past issue with some drivers but uber wa¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15

Hey I am a dedicated Uber rider and would like to see more deals and promotions for the everyday rider. If like me someone who realize on Uber to get them around everyday they (we) should get more promotions. Thank you!¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
Most of the time you don&#39;t see how much you have to pay in advance!!!!¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
Arrivals times over 5 minutes really means 10-15. I’ve had the worst experience with timing. There’s no place to report these inconsistencies.¨x¨x¨¨¨¨4¨15
Good so far, just sometimes it locate some places¨¨x¨¨¨¨4¨15
I think they should do add a feature where you can leave a tip through the app¨x¨¨¨¨¨4¨15
I’ve been using uber since I’ve known about it in 2013 but I would appreciate it the most if they would take their loyal riders’ comments more seriously :)¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
Great and affordable¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
I have rode three different cars and three different drivers all were friendly and polite.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
Only reason was when I used it and my driver saw who I was and canceled on me. I was very offended. But other than that it&#39;s okay. The price raise for UberPool is way too much. I assumed it should&#39;ve been cheaper than UberXL.¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15
Uber is very easy to use and great in not having to carry cash for taxis. MAJOR downside is when connecting to a driver and they're sat stationary for 5 full minutes and they're 3to4 miles away. If i try to cancel because they're not moving im charged 4 po¨¨¨¨¨x¨4¨15

Incompetent website to rate trip. Our trip to LsGuardia this morning should’ve rated a 5 but when I pressed the first star the website closed, registering a 1.  Stupid design!  Should ask for confirmation with the number.  Not at all intuitive how to click¨¨¨¨x¨¨5¨15

Thank you so much for the Uber pass. I use Uber everyday to go to work &amp; I love how the Uber pass saved me around $200. Greatly appreciate Uber for that. Five star!¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨15
Not happy with the fare for a twenty minute drive! Could have used Yellow Cab ( eeeks) for less! NowI have to join Lyft to keep you guys honest! Dad really☹️¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨15
Enjoyed the ride with Fabio immensely because he was so knowledgeable and helpful, but most of all we appreciated how very polite and pleasant he is!¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨15

Seriously Uber has saved me multiple times without a wallet and keys to get into my own vehicle or office. Drivers have been wherever I need even in lame Sacramento at a moments notice. Most of the drivers are people I can relate to- HARD WORKING PEOPLE TH¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨15
Perfecta para esos días que no se quiere manejar o para las salidas de noche en las que quieres beber!¨¨¨¨¨x¨5¨15

Used Uber for the first time on our recent stay in Quebec. Loved it! The app is so easy to use, very intuitive and it was way convenient as a means of traveling around an unknown city not knowing French. Would recommend to anyone.¨¨¨¨x¨¨5¨15
